Welcome to JHM Labs!

The purpose of this website is to broadcast and record our ideas in short articles. This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1]. 

JHM is mathematician originally from Aylmer, Quebec, Canada. 

Our goal is to build a math-physics lab for the 21st century.
Our research includes python, jupyter notebooks, optimal transport, topology of singularities, energy and electrodynamics, history of science, computation, mapping class groups, geometric topology, and whatever else comes along. 

Any questions or comments are welcome at: jhmlabs [*at]* gmail [*dot*] com
