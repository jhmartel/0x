Welcome to JHM Labs.

JHM is a Canadian mathematician, specializing in optimal transport, costs, probability, energy, electrodynamics, topology of singularities, and more. Beyond mathematics, we have interest in natural science, classical physics, economics, monetary policy, commodities, and technology. 

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1]. We are releasing preprints and broadcasting ideas and short articles. Our goal is to regularly release draft articles. Specifically we are interested in developing our python skills, investigating the electrodynamics inspired by Ampere, Weber, and the Brazilian physicist A.K.T. Assis at Unicamp University.
