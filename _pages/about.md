Welcome to JHM Labs !

JHM is a CDN mathematician specializing in optimal transport, costs, energy, electrodynamics, topology of singularity, and more. 

This blog is the beginning of JHM releasing preprints and broadcasting ideas. Our interest is developing our python skill set, and simultaneously developing the electrodynamics inspired by Ampere, Weber, and the Brazilian physicist AKT Assis.

These days [2022-03-17] we are specially interested in the mathematics of insurance and cyber risk. The question of _measuring_ cyber risks is key to enabling profitable cyber insurance policies. This is subject of current research.
