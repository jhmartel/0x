<h1 id="Homogeneous-Wave-Equation,-Lorentz-Transformations-and-SR"><em>Homogeneous Wave Equation, Lorentz Transformations and SR</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Homogeneous-Wave-Equation,-Lorentz-Transformations-and-SR"> </a></h1><p>In Parts 1 and 2 of this series we focussed on Minkowski space, linear algebra of Lorentz transformations, and the null cone. These discussions were mainly based on the photon model of light.</p>
<p>In Part 3 we consider the wave model of light, and specifically properties of Lorentz transformations and the homogeneous wave equation (HWE).</p>
<p>Briefly, Einstein's attempted proof of Claims (i) and (ii) that the Lorentz formulae resolves all the apparent contradictions of (A12) is based on the idea of light propagating a constant speed $c$ which is identical for all observers. From Einstein's spherical wavefront argument, we see that Einstein understood (A12) as implying that light pulses propagate in geometrically spherical wave fronts in <em>every</em> inertial reference frame $K$. In terms of the HWE this implies that there exists a Lorentz invariant class of radial solutions to (HWE). As we discuss below, radial solutions exist canonically for any single reference frame $K$. However the arguments from Parts 1 and 2 demonstrate that no Lorentz invariant set of radial solutions can exist simultaneously for all reference frames $K'$.</p>
<h1 id="d'Alembert-$\square$-is-Unique-Lorentz-Invariant-2nd-Order-Linear-Differential-Operator"><em>d'Alembert</em> $\square$ <em>is Unique Lorentz Invariant 2nd Order Linear Differential Operator</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#d'Alembert-$\square$-is-Unique-Lorentz-Invariant-2nd-Order-Linear-Differential-Operator"> </a></h1><p>In Part 1 we briefly mentioned an interesting result of Elton-Arminjon on the Minkowski metric $$h=d\xi^2 + d\eta^2 + d \zeta^2 - c^2 \tau^2$$ being the unique Lorentz invariant symmetric quadratic form on ${\bf{R}}^4$ (modulo homothety). Their proof has useful corollary in terms of the HWE.</p>
<p>Let $\square$ be d'Alembert's wave operator. Then $\square$ is a second order homogeneous linear differential operator, in coordinates having the form $$\square = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi^2} +\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \eta^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \zeta^2}-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \tau^2}.$$</p>
<p>Informally we view $\square$ as essentially dual to Minkowski's form $h$. Somewhat more rigorously, we find Elton-Arminjon's argument proves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemma: Let $C$ be the algebra of polynomial functions on ${\bf{R}}^4$, and let $\rho^*$ be the contragredient representation of the Lorentz group on $C$. Then d'Alembert's wave operator $\square$ is the unique Lorentz invariant second order linear differential operator on $C$ modulo homothety.</li>
</ul>
<p>It follows that Einstein's Claim (i) that different inertial frames $K, K'$ are related by Lorentz transformations also implies that d'Alembert's operator $\square$ is essentially the unique second order operator defined simultaneously for all inertial observers. This means the HWE is the only Lorentz invariant second order equation on ${\bf{R}}^4$.</p>
<p>The Lorentz invariance of the HWE implies that solutions to the HWE are Lorentz <em>covariant</em>. To be precise, if $\phi=\phi(x,y,z,t)$ is a regular function satisfying the HWE, namely
$$ \phi_{xx}+\phi_{yy}+\phi_{zz}-\frac{1}{c^2}\phi_{tt}=0, $$ and if $\lambda$ is a Lorentz transform with $$(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau)=\lambda.(x,y,z,t),$$ then $$\phi':=\lambda^*(\phi)=\phi\circ\lambda^{-1}$$ is again a solution of the HWE: $$\phi_{\xi \xi}+\phi_{\eta \eta}+\phi_{\zeta \zeta}-\frac{1}{c^2}\phi_{\tau \tau}=0.$$ This is verified by elementary computation.</p>
<p>The above discussion is completely elementary. More significant is the interpretation of (A12) in terms of the HWE.</p>
<h1 id="Radius-is-Not-a-Lorentz-Invariant-Variable"><em>Radius is Not a Lorentz Invariant Variable</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Radius-is-Not-a-Lorentz-Invariant-Variable"> </a></h1><p>We understand (A12) as declaring that there exists a distinguished Lorentz invariant class of solutions to HWE which correspond to spherical light waves. However we argue that this contradicts the properties of HWE. Specifically <em>there does not exist a Lorentz invariant set of radial solutions to the HWE.</em></p>
<p>Indeed the spatial radius variable $r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$ is not a Lorentz invariant variable. This was discussed in Part 2, but we can give another explanation in terms of Lie groups.</p>
<p>In group theoretic terms, a solution $\phi=\phi(x,t)$ of HWE is said to be <em>radial by an observer $K$</em> iff $\phi(Ax,t)=\phi(x,t)$ for every rigid motion $A\in SO(3)$ in the space variables $x,y,z$ of $K$. Implicitly this requires a Lie group representation $\rho$ of $SO(3)$ into the Lorentz group $G\simeq O(3,1)$. But this choice of maximal compact subgroup is noncanonical. Different inertial observers $K, K'$ generally choose different orthogonal symmetry groups, e.g. according to their own physical sum of squares formula $\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2$.</p>
<p>Of course the Minkowski form $h$ is invariant and canonical, but any decomposition into "spatial" and "time" components requires <em>arbitrary observer dependant choices</em>, and these choices cannot be Lorentz invariant.</p>
<p>For example, while the open set of timelike vectors $\{h(v) &lt; 0\}$ is invariantly defined, there is no Lorentz invariant choice of timelike vector. Likewise among the spacelike set $\{h(v)&gt;0\}$ there is no Lorentz invariant choice of orthogonal three-dimensional frame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the motion of light pulses according to (A12) the Minkowski element vanishes identically, and the only canonical tensor element becomes the constant zero element. After a Lorentz change of variables we find a new solution $\phi'$ as above, but this solution need not be radial in the inertial frame $K'$. Indeed the rigid $K$-space motion $A$ will not generally preserve the space coordinates $\xi, \eta, \zeta$ of $K'$. Thus we find $A$-motions nontrivially depend on the $K'$-time variable $\tau$. This again reflects the nonexistence of a Lorentz invariant radius.</p>

<h1 id="Conclusion"><em>Conclusion</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion"> </a></h1><p>This concludes our mathematical analysis of the foundations of SR, especially Einstein's Assumptions (A12) and his attempted resolution via Lorentz formulae and Claims (i) and (ii).</p>
<p>Ultimately the Lorentz transformations do not have the necessary properties to maintain (A12). The so-called Law of Propagation of Light (A2) is not a Lorentz invariant law, and therefore does not itself satisfy the Principle of Restricted Relativity as supposed by Einstein in his Assumption (A1).</p>
<p>In our final Part 4 of this series, we present some potential objections to our arguments and attempt to anticipate some criticisms. However we must maintain that all the above arguments are <em>mathematically correct</em>.
