<h1 id="Apparent-Difficulties-in-SR-and-Einstein's-Attempted-Resolution"><em>Apparent Difficulties in SR and Einstein's Attempted Resolution</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Apparent-Difficulties-in-SR-and-Einstein's-Attempted-Resolution"> </a></h1><p>In the previous article (Part 1/4) we reviewed the basic assumptions of SR, represented in assumptions we call (A1) and (A2).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(A1) that the laws of physics are the same in all nonaccelerated reference frames, i.e. if $K'$ is a coordinate system moving uniformly (and devoid of rotation) with respect to a coordinate system $K$, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to $K'$ according to exactly the same laws as with respect to $K$.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(A2) that light in vacuum propagates along straight lines with constant velocity $c = 300,000 ~km/sec$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The conjunction $(A12):=(A1) \wedge (A2)$ leads to intellectual difficulties, as Einstein himself admits. But these difficulties are only <em>apparent incompatibilities</em> according to Einstein which are resolved by postulating the Lorentz transformations. The assertion that Lorentz formulae resolve all apparent difficulties in (A12) follows from two claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claim (i): that inertial frames $K, K'$ are related by Lorentz transformations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Claim (ii): that the law of propagation of light (A2) is Lorentz invariant. I.e. if  (A2)  is satisfied in  $K$ , then  (A2)  is satisfied in every Lorentz translate  $K′=\lambda.K$.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key issue is verifying whether (A2) really follows from the Claims (i) and (ii). This is the subject of Einstein's spherical wave front argument which we examine below.</p>

<h1 id="Critique-of-Einstein's-Proof-of-the-Compatibility-of-(A12)-with-Lorentz-Transformations"><em>Critique of Einstein's Proof of the Compatibility of (A12) with Lorentz Transformations</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Critique-of-Einstein's-Proof-of-the-Compatibility-of-(A12)-with-Lorentz-Transformations"> </a></h1><p>We were led to reviewing Einstein's SR by reading the articles of S.J. Crothers and R. Bryant, which allege that Einstein's spherical wave proof contains significant errors.</p>
<p>Einstein's argument looks to derive Claim (ii) as a mathematical consequence of Claim (i). The starting point is the fundamental property of Lorentz transformations, that the quadratic expression $$x^2+y^2+z^2 = c^2 t^2$$ is invariant with respect to Lorentz transforms. In other words, the null cone $N$ is Lorentz <em>covariant</em>. Thus if $$(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau)=\lambda. (x,y,z,t)$$ for a Lorentz transform $\lambda$, then we have</p>
<ul>
<li>[Eq1] $$\xi^2 + \eta^2+\zeta^2 = c^2 \tau^2.$$  </li>
</ul>
<p>But what does the expression [Eq1] represent?</p>
<p>Here is Einstein's first error: his argument <em>misidentifies</em> [Eq1] with "the equation of a sphere." The error is subtle. But the fact is that [Eq1] is strictly speaking a three-dimensional cone in the four independant variables $\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau$. The cone indeed contains many spherical two-dimensional subsets, but our point is that <em>a second independant equation</em> is necessary to specify these spheres. And these independant equations cannot be chosen Lorent invariantly!</p>
<p>Penrose in his textbook with Rindler is quite careful here. The Penrose approach is to projectivize [Eq1] and obtain a <em>projective sphere</em> with a uniquely defined Lorentz invariant conformal structure.</p>
<p>But again we must emphasize that there is no canonical metric invariant with respect to the Lorentz group on the projectivization. In otherwords, the null sphere has a Lorentz invariant conformal structure, but it does not have a Lorentz invariant Riemannian structure.</p>
<p>For instance the standard round sphere $S$ centred at the origin simultaneously satisfies [Eq1] and additionally the equation $$\frac{1}{2}d(\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2)=\xi d\xi+\eta d\eta +\zeta d\zeta=0.$$ In short, the round sphere requires that <em>two</em> quadratic forms $\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2$ and $c^2\tau^2$ be <em>simultaneously constant</em>.</p>
<p>This leads us to Einstein's second error, which is the failure to observe that the Lorentz invariance of the quadratic form $h=x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2$ in no way implies the Lorentz invariance of $h_1:=x^2+y^2+z^2$ and $h_2:=c^2 t^2$.</p>
<p>Indeed the quadratic forms $h_1, h_2$ are degenerate, with nontrivial radicals $rad(h_1)=\{x=y=z=0\}$ and $rad(h_2)=\{t=0\}.$ The radicals are linear subspaces of ${\bf{R}}^4$. But if $h_1, h_2$ are invariant, then $rad(h_1)$ and $rad(h_2)$ are also nontrivial invariant subspaces. This contradicts the fact that the standard linear representation of the Lorentz group acts irreducibly on ${\bf{R}}^4$.</p>
<p>To summarize the two errors in Einstein's famous argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the cone $\xi^2 + \eta^2+\zeta^2 = c^2 \tau^2$ is misidentified as the equation of a sphere.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the Lorentz invariance of $\xi^2 + \eta^2+\zeta^2 = c^2 \tau^2$ does not imply the Lorentz invariance of the forms $\xi^2 + \eta^2+\zeta^2$ and $c^2 \tau^2$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In otherwords, the numerical equality between $\xi^2 + \eta^2+\zeta^2$ and $c^2\tau^2$ is always maintained, but the actual values attained by the expressions is <em>not</em> Lorentz invariant.</p>
<p>We are repeating ourselves because this is somewhat subtle point which is easily overlooked.</p>

<h1 id="Elementary-Computations-in-${\bf{R}}^{1,1}$"><em>Elementary Computations in</em> ${\bf{R}}^{1,1}$<a class="anchor-link" href="#Elementary-Computations-in-${\bf{R}}^{1,1}$"> </a></h1><p>To illustrate the above ideas, it's convenient to examine some elementary computations in two variables. Thus we consider ${\bf{R}^2}$ with $(x,t)$ and $(\xi, \tau)$ coordinates.</p>
<p>For numerical convenience we set $c:=1$.</p>
<p>Thus $h=x^2-t^2$ is a quadratic form on ${\bf{R}}^2$ invariant with respect to the one-dimensional Lorentz group $G=SO(1,1)_0$ generated by $$a_\theta:=\begin{pmatrix} \cosh \theta &amp; \sinh \theta \\
\sinh \theta &amp; \cosh \theta
\end{pmatrix}$$ for $\theta\in {\bf{R}}$.</p>
<p>In two dimensions the null cone $$N=\{x^2-t^2=0\}$$ projectivizes to a $0$-dimensional sphere consisting of two projective points represented by the affine lines $x-t=0$ and $x+t=0$.</p>
<p>The round $0$-dimensional sphere $\{x^2=1\}$ consists of two vectors in the null cone, namely $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, ~~~\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}.$$</p>
<p>Left translating these vectors by $a_\theta$ we find the translates $$\begin{pmatrix} \xi \\ \tau \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} \cosh \theta+\sinh \theta \\ \cosh \theta+\sinh \theta \end{pmatrix}~~\text{and} \begin{pmatrix} -\cosh \theta+\sinh \theta \\ \cosh \theta-\sinh \theta \end{pmatrix}.$$</p>
<p>But evidently $$\xi^2 \neq x^2=1^2=1$$ and $$\tau^2 \neq t^2=1$$ when $\theta\neq 0$. Thus the quadratic forms $h_1=x^2$ and $h_2=t^2$ <em>are not</em> $a_\theta$-invariant. Likewise we find the image of the unit sphere $x^2=1$ does not correspond to a spatial sphere in $(\xi, \tau)$ coordinates.</p>
<p>These trivial computations have the effect of falsifying the alleged Lorentz invariance of spherical lightwaves. However the ``slope" of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ and $$a_\theta.\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} \cosh \theta+\sinh \theta \\ \cosh \theta+\sinh \theta \end{pmatrix}$$ is identically equal to $c=1$ in accordance with (A2).</p>
<p>To further illustrate earlier comments on the nonexistence of canonical parameters on $N$, consider that for any $C^1$ monotonic function 
$$ f: {\bf{R}} \to {\bf{R}} $$ we obtain a curve $$\epsilon(t)=\epsilon_f(t)=\begin{pmatrix} f(t) \\ f(t)   \end{pmatrix}=f(t) \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ for $t\in {\bf{R}}$.</p>
<p>Then $\epsilon_f(t)$ is supported on a straight line in $N$, and the "photon" $\epsilon_f$ can be said <em>to propagate in a straight line with constant speed</em> $c=1$.</p>
<p>It might be said that $\epsilon_f$ is <em>not uniform</em> in the parameter $t$, but we argue that there exists no <em>Lorentz invariant</em> definition of "uniform parameter" on the null cone.</p>
<p>This is related to our discussion in Part 1 on Levi-Civita's attempt to derive a geodesic equation for light propagation, i.e. the hypothesis that light travels with zero acceleration. We reasoned that this is an arbitrary additional hypothesis, and not a consequence of the formal assumptions (A12).</p>
<p>In the remaining Parts 3/4 and 4/4 of this article, we consider the homogeneous wave equations and Lorentz transformations. As we have previously indicated, we find (A12) incompatible with <em>both</em> the wave and particle models of light.</p>
