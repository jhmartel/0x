In this post we make simple comments on an interesting pseudo partial derivative which arises in application. We would expect a Kronecker delta, but the reality is somewhat different. For calculus of relational mechanics this is very important basic computation.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Weber Hamilton Two Body Equations.

Which model is more probable, Bohr's or Sansbury's? It's a billion dollar question. This post has alot of words but not enough calculations. We need to figure out the correct KDK integration scheme for Weber's potential, and this is work in progress. Remember that nobody has seen the atom, and it is essentially unseeable since it does not radiate energy to the environment. But it's perhaps more structured than classical and quantum theories allow.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Brief Update</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2023/01/21/Update_NotMuchToReport.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brief Update" /><published>2023-01-21T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-21T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2023/01/21/Update_NotMuchToReport</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been writing alot, but nothings finished.

To publish ideas, brief articles, and to collect and broadcast our work. All the posts reflect many years of work, although the physics posts are much more recent. We left academia, we failed to publish papers, and this is why we live in obscurity with nobody reading or mindful of our work. My hope is that this blog survives longer than I do, and at least the ideas are recorded here for posterity. This is our fault and we're fixing it.]]></summary></entry></feed>
