We return again to Weber force laws and two body problems, with special attention given to the possible attractive forces between identical negatively charged particles. This is one of the key predictions of Weber's force law, as addressed previously on this blog. The point is that a large amount of energy and work is required to push the particles through the critical radius r_c where suddenly the sign flips in the force term, or equivalently the object inherits a negative inertial mass. And this is the true meaning of E=mc^2 as we've explained.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Colloquium.

These are points x which minimize the average euclidean distance from the points supporting a probability measure mu on Rn. The problem is that mathematicians need to stop asking for formulas for naive geometric questions. Besides formulas are not as useful as they might initially appear. Instead fast approximation and convergence are much more useful, although the resultant is not known a priori.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Stabilize Blum’s Medial Axis Transform.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/10/15/StabilizingMAT.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Stabilize Blum’s Medial Axis Transform." /><published>2022-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/10/15/StabilizingMAT</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brief remark on stabilizing the medial axis transform M(A) of open subsets A of Rn.

This video caused surprising uproar from physicists and engineers. The surprising degree of controversy is indicative a deep misunderstanding underlying electromagnetism, and this is where Weber-Kirchoff's original idea of surface charge distributions proportional to voltage being the cause of steady state currents in resistive wires. We recall that Weber and Kirchoff are the first scientists to derive the telegraphy equation, which predicts that electrical signals in conductive wires travel at the speed of light $c$. This is important work even prior to Maxwell's equations.]]></summary></entry></feed>
