These are points x which minimize the average euclidean distance from the points supporting a probability measure mu on Rn. The problem is that mathematicians need to stop asking for formulas for naive geometric questions. Besides formulas are not as useful as they might initially appear. Instead fast approximation and convergence are much more useful, although the resultant is not known a priori.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Stabilize Blum’s Medial Axis Transform.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/10/15/StabilizingMAT.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Stabilize Blum’s Medial Axis Transform." /><published>2022-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/10/15/StabilizingMAT</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brief remark on stabilizing the medial axis transform M(A) of open subsets A of Rn. The basic idea is to use the Reduction-to-Singularity method from our thesis to define homotopy-reductions M(A) to W(A). This is speculative and not formally proven at this stage.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Weber-Kirchoff’s Response to Veritasium’s Huge Circuit Problem</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2022/10/08/Veritasium_Response.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Weber-Kirchoff’s Response to Veritasium’s Huge Circuit Problem" /><published>2022-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2022/10/08/Veritasium_Response</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post we present what we believe Weber and Kirchoff's solution to Veritasium's video on electricity. This video caused surprising uproar from physicists and engineers. The surprising degree of controversy is indicative a deep misunderstanding underlying electromagnetism, and this is where Weber-Kirchoff's original idea of surface charge distributions proportional to voltage being the cause of steady state currents in resistive wires. We recall that Weber and Kirchoff are the first scientists to derive the telegraphy equation, which predicts that electrical signals in conductive wires travel at the speed of light $c$. This is important work even prior to Maxwell's equations.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Deciding Injectivity and C.A.Feinstein’s Proposed Negative Solution to P vs NP.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2022/10/06/Feinstein_Part2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Deciding Injectivity and C.A.Feinstein’s Proposed Negative Solution to P vs NP." /><published>2022-10-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2022/10/06/Feinstein_Part2</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We continue to review and reflect on questions suggested by Craig Alan Feinstein's proposed negative solution to P versus NP. We are specifically reflecting on a signed subset sum problem, which is effectively a linearization of the unsigned subset sum. The question then reduces to deciding the injectivity of a map, namely from a large dimensional finite object to a much smaller dimensional but infinite object, namely integers. This raises the question of what is the computational complexity of deciding injectivity of maps? Is it really ever possible to deterministically decide the injectivity of a map without necessarily running through every evaluation? Along the way we discuss several aspects of CAF's work.]]></summary></entry></feed>
