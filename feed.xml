To publish ideas, brief articles, and to collect and broadcast our work. All the posts reflect many years of work, although the physics posts are much more recent. We left academia, we failed to publish papers, and this is why we live in obscurity with nobody reading or mindful of our work. My hope is that this blog survives longer than I do, and at least the ideas are recorded here for posterity. This is our fault and we're fixing it.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Zero Subset Sums and Laurent Polynomials</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2023/01/15/PolynomialSubsetSums.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Zero Subset Sums and Laurent Polynomials" /><published>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/2023/01/15/PolynomialSubsetSums</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have an idea about computing zero subset sums using Laurent polynomials and symbolic calculators. Essentially expanding powers of Laurent polynomials is computationally equivalent to sampling subsets of integers. It's trivial, but it's something useful that we've used with Mathematica and here with SymPy. There's an idea here which we probably learned from Dror Bar-Natan's Shameless Mathematica course and his categorical construction of Khovanov homology, Alexander polynomials, and Euler characteristics, etc..You can do alot with trivial observations!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome Back.
