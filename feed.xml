Is O(log(n)) provably the minimal time complexity of computing fibonacci sequences? Can we formalize Wolfram's definition and obtain a strategy for proving the minimality of these running times?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Update] Weber Two Body Problem with Python and Gekko</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/13/Weber_TwoBody_Ctd.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Update] Weber Two Body Problem with Python and Gekko" /><published>2022-09-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/13/Weber_TwoBody_Ctd</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post we present the basic python and gekko code for simulating two negatively charged electrons acting under Weber's force. The challenge is to obtain bounded orbits, i.e. to witness electrons passing the Weber critical radius and becoming attractive. As we've discussed in previous posts, this requires high energy levels comparable to the famous $E=m c^2$ formula.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Under Construction] Weber Three Body Problem.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/11/WeberThreeBody.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Under Construction] Weber Three Body Problem." /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/11/WeberThreeBody</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our goal in this post is to integrate the equations of motion for three charged bodies under Weber's force law. Why? Because we want to test the Sansbury proposal that the electron $e^{-}$ is structured, specifically as a 3-body system with net charge -1=-1-1+1. Yes, this is strange hypothesis and very important to investigate. But there is a challenge: the Newtonian equations of motion combined with Weber force are not the usual second order ODEs. This means we need to introduce a Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) solver named GEKKO, and this has delayed the publication of this post. With GEKKO we can solve ODEs of the form $F(x, x', x'')=0$. This post is theoretical. But we are working on the python notebooks for the actual code for Weber 3-body problem with net charge -1 = -1 -1 + 1.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Under Construction] Weber Sansbury’s Structured Planetary Model of the Atom</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/04/WeberPlanetaryModel.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Under Construction] Weber Sansbury’s Structured Planetary Model of the Atom" /><published>2022-09-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/04/WeberPlanetaryModel</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bohr and quantum mechanics never explained the apparent nonradiation of the hydrogen atom. It was instead postulated, taken as given, and led to the quantum discontinuities, etc... But the great Wilhelm Weber (1804-1891) and the quiet softspoken Ralph Sansbury have a very interesting alternative, which answers everything that Bohr and Quantum could not, and succeeds where they surrendered, which is explaining the stability of atoms.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">E=mc^2 but what does it mean?</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/03/mc2_part2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="E=mc^2 but what does it mean?" /><published>2022-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/03/mc2_part2</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[E=mc^2 is the most famous formula in history, but what does it mean? Here we emphasize that Einstein derived the formula from mathematics in 1905, but Wilhelm Weber derived the formula from physics in 1860. With Einstein there is no meaning, no physics; but Weber has an immediate meaning in his particle electrodynamics, and E=mc^2 represents an incredible fact about Weber's critical radius and the possibility of 2=+1+1 as a stable electronic system!]]></summary></entry></feed>
