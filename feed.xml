We continue to work on Weber two body problem with a view towards the more general N body problem. Again the challenge is that Weber's force law leads to second order linear differential equations which contain the acceleration terms implicitly. And this is obstruction to using the standard ODE solvers available to python. We have therefore been using a DAE (specifically GEKKO) to integrate the equations of state for the two body systems. However GEKKO does not offer as much visibility into the DAE solver as we would like. Therefore we have limited confidence in the accuracy of the solutions obtained.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Colloquium.

These are points x which minimize the average euclidean distance from the points supporting a probability measure mu on Rn. The problem is that mathematicians need to stop asking for formulas for naive geometric questions. Besides formulas are not as useful as they might initially appear. Instead fast approximation and convergence are much more useful, although the resultant is not known a priori.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Stabilize Blum’s Medial Axis Transform.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/10/15/StabilizingMAT.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Stabilize Blum’s Medial Axis Transform." /><published>2022-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/10/15/StabilizingMAT</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brief remark on stabilizing the medial axis transform M(A) of open subsets A of Rn.
