It was instead postulated, taken as given, and led to the quantum discontinuities, etc... But the great Wilhelm Weber (1804-1891) and the quiet softspoken Ralph Sansbury have a very interesting alternative, which answers everything that Bohr and Quantum could not, and succeeds where they surrendered, which is explaining the stability of atoms.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">E=mc^2 but what does it mean?</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/03/mc2_part2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="E=mc^2 but what does it mean?" /><published>2022-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/03/mc2_part2</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[E=mc^2 is the most famous formula in history, but what does it mean? Here we emphasize that Einstein derived the formula from mathematics in 1905, but Wilhelm Weber derived the formula from physics in 1860. With Einstein there is no meaning, no physics; but Weber has an immediate meaning in his particle electrodynamics, and E=mc^2 represents an incredible fact about Weber's critical radius and the possibility of 2=+1+1 as a stable electronic system!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Remarks on Craig Alan Feinstein’s papers and P versus NP.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/03/PversusNP.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Remarks on Craig Alan Feinstein’s papers and P versus NP." /><published>2022-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/09/03/PversusNP</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our attention has recently been drawn to Craig Alan Feinstein's work on P vs NP, and we record some ideas below. Basically we find that IF P is not equal to NP, then it will be unprovable because one cannot formally prove lower bounds on worst case complexity of algorithms. Or this is our impression at the moment.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An Idea on Constructing Counterexamples to Larry Guth’s Sponge Problem using Jammed Packings.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/08/31/GuthSpongeCounterexamplesViaPackings.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Idea on Constructing Counterexamples to Larry Guth’s Sponge Problem using Jammed Packings." /><published>2022-08-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/08/31/GuthSpongeCounterexamplesViaPackings</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We record some ideas based on rigid disk packings to potentially construct open sets with arbitarily small volume and which cannot be expanded-embedded into the unit disk.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Preprint on Closing Steinberg Symbols in Mapping Class Group with Applications to Constructing Spines.</title><link href="https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/08/30/MCG_CS_Article_Available.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Preprint on Closing Steinberg Symbols in Mapping Class Group with Applications to Constructing Spines." /><published>2022-08-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jhmartel.github.io/fp/fastpages/jupyter/2022/08/30/MCG_CS_Article_Available</id><author><name>JHM</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mapping Class Group, Bieri-Eckmann duality, spines, Teichmueller space]]></summary></entry></feed>
