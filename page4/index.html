    Fizeau and Sansbury
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description">Here we begin analysis of Fizeau's classical sawtooth experiment (1849) with Sansbury's proposed setup. While Fizeau studies a saw tooth wheel in uniform motion on the order of twenty rotations per second, Sansbury's setup can be interpreted as either the same wheel in nonuniform motion, or a wheel with variable saw tooth length in uniform motion. We argue that Sansbury's predictions could be tested if Fizeau's wheel could increase it's angular velocity from 20 revolutions per second, to 80 revolutions or 160 revolutions per second. </p><p class="post-meta">Apr 29, 2022</p>

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">Continuing our discussion on OT and GR. Here we focus on whether costs always need to be energetic in order for the expected value of the cost to be physically well-defined. We continue our discussion on whether the expected proper time interpretation of is justified.</p><p class="post-meta">Apr 27, 2022</p>

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">Einstein SR, Homogeneous Wave Equation, Lorentz Group, Maxwell. This is update of a previous post. The Critical Foundations of SR and Light Propagation in Vacuum is basically complete. We have a critical analysis of Einstein's alleged proof of Lorentz invariance of spherical lightwaves, and other things. What the article really needs is a stronger conclusion with a study of a modified Fizeau sawtooth experiment.</p><p class="post-meta">Apr 26, 2022</p>

    Yao&#39;s Millionaire&#39;s Problem. Part 1.
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description"> We begin the study of Yao's Millionaire Problem, approaching via convex analysis. Two players have secret points, and the first player to guess an affine function separating the secrets wins. The question is whether the optimal strategy is uniform on the domain, or whether there is some variation in the density. This is elaborated below using both python and some elementary convex analysis.</p><p class="post-meta">Apr 20, 2022</p>

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">How to save money on moving and delivery? Basically prepare and pack as much as possible into as many closed cardboard boxes as necessary, and order a large truck for transport. We also discuss the basic questions which are most useful for estimating the total cost of moving a household. This manages the client's expectations, but also allows the moving manager to maximize their profit and schedule themselves accordingly.</p><p class="post-meta">Apr 5, 2022</p>

    Radioactive Gold Remediation

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">Recent changes in the insurance policy of the Royal Canadian Mint, and comments by the analyst Jim Rickards, reveals the risk of radioactive contamination of precious metals and bullion holdings. In this brief note, we simply observe that Safire, Aureon, Clarage, Childs, and EU have proposed a very important solution for nuclear remediation and waste management. Basically by exposing the bullion to H+ ion bombardment, the rate of radioactive decay can be accelerated. </p><p class="post-meta">Mar 25, 2022</p>
