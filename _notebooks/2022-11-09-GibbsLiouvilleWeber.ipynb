        "The classical Gibbs-Liouville theorem says that the canonical volume form $dxdv$ on state space is invariant with respect to Hamiltonian evolution. In otherwords, for a given rectange $dx dv$ of initial conditions in statespace, the forward time evolution of the Hamiltonian system with these given initial conditions occupies a region in $xv$-spave having the same volume with respect to $dx dv$. \n",

        "\n",
        "Our interpretation of the time evolution being volume invariant means the overall \"uncertainty\" in the states is constant. In other words if we know position $x$ with some error $dx$ and velocity $v$ with error $dv$, then the overall uncertainty of the system remains $dx dv$ square-error throughout the evolution. This is relatively good, for example if the particles very close (so $dx$ is small), then we are certain that $dv$ is large (i.e. they have large relative motion). Likewise if the particles have very small relative motion ($dv$ small) then the particles have large relative position ($dx$ large).\n",

        "- for $\\alpha > 0 $ the divergence has two phases. For relatively large distances $x$ outside the critical radius $r_c$ we see the divergence is positive, and therefore state-space uncertainty is increasing under the flow. This means the positions and velocities of particles become more dispersed with time. They will spread out and cover a larger volume of state space. However _inside the critical radius_ $0 < x < r_c$ the divergence changes sign and becomes negative. This means inside the critical radius the state-space uncertainty is decreasing with respect to time. I.e. there will be stronger and stronger correlations between position and velocity and much less dispersion.\n",
