        "1. The Qiskit and quantum computing has reached the following stage: the mathematical theory is perfect but incomplete, unsatisfactory, and the physical interpretation is not sufficient. [Insert comment: there is tensorial categorical issue with the quantum definitions of observables and projections of variables, e.g. the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and interpretations. This tensorial definition is provided by Gromov in his ERGO brain papers and specifically his paper \"In Search of Structure Part 1: Entropy\".]\n",

        "Now let me say that these statements are True, but they are also True evidence that Quantum is unacceptable. It is admittedly inconsistent in its very foundations, at its root, genesis, and zero block. So why is quantum accepted at all? Because there is something useful about it. So let us continue to be guided by pragmatism. _What's useful_? \n",

        "Another remark on Bohr's claim. There is something _shocking_ in quantum physics, and this is well documented in the historical accounts of Bohr, Planck, and Einstein. And what is the _shock_? It is found in Bohr's planetary two-body model of the hydrogen atom which violates classical physics. More specifically, the apparent non-radiation of Bohr's planetary model of the hydrogen atom is the shocking postulate. But the apparent nonradiation is an ad hoc postulate, and which is contradictory to the classical dynamics. Quantum is shocking for those who try to explain the atom via classical electrodynamics, e.g. the Maxwell field theory and Lorentz force laws. However as Weber and Gauss understood from Ampere's Newtonian theory of electricity, there are many more dynamic and stable configurations in Weber's relational action-at-a-distance model than the standard Lorentz-Maxwell field framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we view Niels Bohr's above statement as __True__. Indeed for the student to accept the mathematical premise of Bohr's quantum theory is to positively reject the classical physics, because Bohr does not _resolve_ the problem of the apparently non-radiating hydrogen atom . Rather he takes this apparent non-radiation as a fundamental postulate, regardless of its apparent irreconciliability with the basic classical theory of two-body electronic systems. \n",

        "Update: I've been looking for work since around November 2021. Today is June 2022, so that makes approximately seven months unemployed. I work labour jobs on the side, but that's just to make ends meet. I will say I consider it quite demoralizing and humiliating to be ready, willing, and able to work a job, and yet having no job. I'm sorry my excuse is I'm too talented and too skilled and too good to be working labour like a beast. The consequences of this choice are this: instead of readily earning 32$/hour as entry level wage, I'm poor and effectively homeless. But I'm a dreamer, and i'm called to do physics and mathematics, and I'll do it until I die.\n",

        "0. I have recently updated my special relativity paper titled [\"On Critical Foundations of SR and Light Propagation in Vacuum\"](https://github.com/jhmartel/SR/).  I actually think the paper is quite readable at this stage. The main idea is simply a modification of Fizeau's spinning wheel experiment following a suggestion of Ralph Sansbury which -- at least to my mind -- would be decisive in demonstrating that \"light\" is really something that \"travel through space\". \n",
        "\n",
        "Remark. In Maxwell's treatise, especially the final chapters of Vol II, and his review of action-at-a-distance theories of Gauss, Weber, Neumann, etc., Maxwell is clear that it's _inconceivable_ for him to imagine light as anything other than a \"particle\" which necessarily travels through space. This presumption then leads to the confused issue of whether light is particle or wave or somehow both? (I.e. Bohr complementarity). \n",
