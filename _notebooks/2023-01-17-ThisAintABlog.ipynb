All the posts reflect many years of work, although the physics posts are much more recent. We left academia, we failed to publish papers, and this is why we live in obscurity with nobody reading or mindful of our work. My hope is that this blog survives longer than I do, and at least the ideas are recorded here for posterity.\" \n",
