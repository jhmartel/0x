The main question remains, What is the correct law of propagation of light. The answer is perhaps that light is not something that propagates, i.e. light is not something that travels, but is rather related to instanteous action-at-a-distance, which cumulates in the atom and eventually electrons to be excited in the outer band and thereby cause the stimulus response known as light. This is Sansbury's idea, still unverified. \"\n",

        "We've been working on an [essay](www.github.com/jhmartel/SR/) on the foundations of special relativity (SR). Why do we invest so much time and effort into SR foundations ? Well honestly because i think the foundations are never taught, so there's alot to say. Moreover the SR converts tend to ignore foundations, evading them and jumping ahead to their conclusions. So the task of foundations is typically neglected by adherents, and it's left to the skeptics to develop the foundational issues. And the student of the history of SR will know that there has _always_ been a strong skeptic school in SR (and GR) and this school frequently included Einstein himself at various times in his life, and for good reason. There is _much_ to critically examine in the SR theory, and this the purpose of our essay.\n"

        "Einstein's theory of special relativity (SR) arose from Einstein's study of Maxwell's equations (ME) circa 1870 AD. But what is the logical and mathematical relation between SR and Maxwell? This is interesting question because they are essentially antagonistic. Although Einstein was much influenced by the Maxwellian field theory viewpoint, his own early work (1905) was based on the antithetical _photon_ model of light.\n",
        "\n",
        "Briefly, by Maxwell equations we understand that in a given reference frame $K$ we have the existence of electric and magnetic fields $E,B$ satisfying the four equations on $div(E), div(B)$ and $curl(E)$ and $curl(B)$ relative to a charge volume density $\\rho$ and electric current density $J$. In vacuum where $\\rho=0$ and $J=0$, composing the first-order Maxwell equations together yields the second-order fact that the coordinate components of $E,B$ satisfy wave equations with speed of propagation $c=\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0}$. This usually leads to the idea that electromagnetic field disturbances travel at the speed of $c$ in aether. And indeed Maxwell's equations expressly assume an aether as the medium by the which the electromagnetic radiation travels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now this author does not really accept Maxwell's field equations as being satisfactory. For example, the magnetic field $B$ is not a rectifiable or reifiable field, meaning it has only _potential_ and not any material substance. The same could be said for Maxwell's electric field, which again is a potential field describing the force experienced by a charged test particle. \n",
        "This is the so-called _continental field-theoretic viewpoint_ after Maxwell, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "However Maxwell's equations were not satisfactory in their predictions on the photoelectric effect. For example, is light a disturbance in the electric _or_ the magnetic field? If light is such a disturbance, then Maxwell equations predict the interaction of the $E$-wave (or is it $B$-wave) with charged test particles. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here it's interesting to compare Einstein's 1905 explanation of the photoelectric effect using the photon particle theory of light. Thus we tend to interpret Einstein's developments of SR from a photon or corpuscular point of view. \n",
        "\n",
        "_Problem_: The classical homogeneous wave equation has the property of the velocity being _dependant_ on the receiver velocity relative to the medium. But SR argues that the assumption on the \"rectilinear uniform propagation of light\" somehow yields a wave equation where velocity is receiver _independant_. But how?
