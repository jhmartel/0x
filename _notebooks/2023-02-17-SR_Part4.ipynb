        "One might object that all our arguments reduce to the observation that spheres in the frame $K$ are transformed to ellipsoids in $K'$ as is well-known. \n",
        "\n",
        "But we remind the reader that Lorentz contraction is assumed to affect _material_ objects, even independantly of the nature of the material. So material spheres in $K$ become material ellipsoids in $K'$, where the eccentricity of the $K'$-ellipsoid is nontrivial and independant of the material nature of the sphere. However we respond that light spheres are _immaterial_ and not themselves subject to Lorentz contraction. And indeed if light spheres were subject to the same contraction effects as material spheres, then (A2) would definitely be false.\n",

        "Critics may object that (A12) only requires the consistent _measurement_ of $c$ in arbitrary reference frames $K, K'$. This would replace the law (A2) with some rule of thumb for measurements. \n",
        "\n",
        "But this immediately leads to a well-known experimental difficulty at the core of special relativity, namely the impossibility of measuring the _one way_ speed of light. Indeed space and time measurements are always dependant on material objects and often non local, having sources and receivers separated by large distances. The impossibility of synchronizing non local clocks leads to the impossibility of measuring the one-way velocity of light. That all measurements of $c$ only succeed in measuring the _two way_ or \"round trip\" velocities of light where source and receiver coincide is discussed in [Zhang 1997] and [Perez 2011].  See also Veritasium's video \"Why the Speed of Light Can't be Measured\". \n",

Our presentation has addressed both corpuscular and undulatory models, showing that (A12) is underdetermined in both cases. The incompatibility of (A12) with both the wave and particle model has been highlighted by A.K.T. Assis [Section 7.2.4, pp.133] from his \"Relational Mechanics\":\n",
