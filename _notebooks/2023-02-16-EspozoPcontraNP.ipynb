Or almost equivalently, of deciding the support of the image of a function $F$. E.g. for the subset sum problem, the image is the pushforward onto $\\bf{Z}$ of the sum total $\\epsilon: 2^X \\to {\\bf{Z}}$.\n",

In this sense, complexity is equivalent to \"entropy\" as defined by Gromov [insert ref].\n",
