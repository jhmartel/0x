In this post we make simple comments on an interesting pseudo partial derivative which arise in applications. We would expect a Kronecker delta, but the reality is somewhat different. For calculus of relational mechanics this is very important basic computation, so must eventually be addressed by any practitioner.\" \n",

        "I have some partial derivatives which I cannot evaluate. But the problem is that they are not really partial derivatives because partial derivatives assume the existence of independant Cartesian coordinates. We rather look at the relative distances $\\{ r_{ij}\\}$ and the relative radial velocities $\\nu_{ij}:={\\hat{r_{ij}}} \\cdot v_{ij}$ where $v_{ij}$ is the relative velocity of the particles $i,j$. Here $r^2_{ij}:=|x_i - x_j|^2$. Then ${\\hat{r}}_{ij}$ is the relative unit vector from $i$ to $j$ particles. If we have an $N$ body system with particles $x_i$ and velocities $v_i$, then we define the relational Weber Hamiltonian by the expression\n",
