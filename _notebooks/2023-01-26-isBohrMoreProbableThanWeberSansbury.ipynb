        "> \"[Chaos Post: Everything Under Construction] A simple question with non obvious answer. Which model is more probable, Bohr's or Sansbury's? It's a billion dollar question. This post has alot of words but not enough calculations. We need to figure out the correct KDK integration scheme for Weber's potential, and this is work in progress. Remember that nobody has seen the atom, and it is essentially unseeable since it does not radiate energy to the environment. But it's perhaps more structured than classical and quantum theories allow.\" \n",

        "\n",
        "_For example the system $[-1, -1]$ is naturally repulsive in isolated environment, but becomes a system $[-2]$ only if sufficient work is done by the environment on the system. We have written on this elsewhere, namely Weber's amazing prediction that electrons are attractive within the critical radius and an energy $E=\\mu c^2$ is required, where $\\mu$ is the reduced inertial mass of the system._\n",

        "The question of which states or models are more probable is effectively an energy and statistical question. It's generally understood from thermodynamics that more probable states are those with lower potential energies (i.e. with less capacity for work). There is urgent need for precise statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thermodynamics is the question relating the changes in potential $\\Delta U$ with changes in \"capacity for work\" and \"heat flux with the environment\". It's a complicated question and we are cautious against unwitting import of false ideas. Somehow what's lacking is the amazing idea that heat and temperature represents average random kinetic. \n",

        "\n",
        "Truly if the states are isolated, then they are not observable at all, at least not by energy radiation. For if they were radiating they would be transferring some energy from the system to the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstractly we need to study the energy landscapes of all these systems. The potential energy in our study is Weber's electrodynamic potential and which satisfies a conservation of energy with respect to both isolated and non-isolated systems in a form. \n",
        "\n",
        "The system will use it's own potential energy, to do work on itself to morphologically change it's state. And the environment is here necessary to absorb this energy. The system will relax to a lower state, but the environment will have absorbed and gained to a higher state. It seems natural enough to assume that this dynamic process will continue until we have achieved an energy balance and no more net radiation. \n",
        "\n",
        "We are repeating to ourselves the idea of \"spontaneous reduction to ground states\" as some natural principle of least action, or least internal energy. In otherwords, a system reacts to its environment to minimize the internal potential energy. Both states will have attained minimal internal potential energy. \n",
        "\n",
        "It's necessary to consider the environment, because if we look at unconstrained negative energy gradient $-\\nabla E$ on the isolated system, then the gradient might descend to zero or negative infinity and radiate away all its energy. System collapses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead we remember the environment $X$ and the idea that all energy is conserved and there is radiation until an energy balance is achieved between $S$ and $X$. If the environment itself has a capacity (a ceiling) possibly infinite of how much energy it can absorb, then the system $S$ need not radiate away to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our calculations between Bohr and Sansbury, it's possible that studying the isolated systems will not be sufficient. They each have their own energy landscapes. But without any environment interactions, is it possible to decide which configurations are more probable? Can the absolute energies really be compared to each other? And besides, for a given configuration, what is the most probable state?\n",
        "\n",
        "In strict two-body system like $[+1, -1]$ there is no direct radiation from $[+1]$ to $[-1]$ because there is no energy balance necessary between $[+1]$ and $[-1]$ (single-particle systems do not have any relational energies -- the particles do have absolute vis viva kinetic energies relative to any coordinate system, but no pure relational kinetic energy!). Therefore there is no energy transfer between the states. When the particles begin interacting in the two-body system $[+1, -1]$ then there is exchange between potential and relative kinetic energies of the system. However this does not occur as radiation but rather a change of state. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a system like $[[+2, -1], [+1, -2]]$, it's possible that the system have zero net radiation (effectively isolated and stable) whilst the subsystems $[+2, -1]$ and $[+1, -2]$ undergoes a continuous exchange of radiation while maintaining a total energy balance. This is Sansbury's insight.\n",
