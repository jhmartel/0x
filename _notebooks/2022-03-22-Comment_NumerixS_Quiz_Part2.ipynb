This is related the idea of \"casting out nines\" or \"casting out threes\" from integers. So the only possibly answers for the composition is multiples of $9$: like $9, 18, 27$, etc.. But i figured the number in question $333^{333}$ is very large, so it likely has alot of multiples of $9$, and i chose $18$ as the answer. But that was a guess. \n",

The tenth coin is not fair, and flips to heads with probability 1 (i.e. the tenth coin has only heads). \n",

Finally we can determine $P(X)$ by the formula $$P(X)=P(X | FC) P(FC) + P(X | UC) P (UC).$$ Here $FC$ refers to the event of a \"fair coin\" being selected. Thus we find $$P(X)=\\frac{1}{2^3} \\frac{9}{10} + 1 \\frac{1}{10} = .\\frac{1}{10} \\frac{17}{8}.$$ Therefore $$P(UC |X ) = 1 . \\frac{1}{10} \\frac{10 . 8}{ 17}=\\frac{8}{17}.$$\n",
