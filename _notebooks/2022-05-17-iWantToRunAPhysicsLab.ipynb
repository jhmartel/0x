        "So i tell people that i want to run a physics lab in five years. The typical response is \"But what do you know about physics or running a physics lab?\" And that's a fair question for the general population. But what don't i know about physics that i need to know? Surely plenty, but why should that stop me from running a lab? \n",

        "My background -- what i always tell people -- is that in high school i decided i wanted to be a mathematician. It was a calling, and it was a dream that i pursued for 12+ years, and that dream continues and has brought me here. So here i am now telling you my dream is to run a physics lab. Do you doubt it? \n",

And i don't mean modern theoretical physics, but very relevant to classical physics. Let us remember that all the great physics was performed in 19th and 18th century by gentleman and gentlewomen of modest means, but of extraordinary mind and ability. We are especially mindful of Faraday, Ampere, and Weber. Moreover Gauss and Riemann themselves were especially physically oriented.\n",

        "Are \"trained physicists\" the only persons qualified to run physics labs? No, but they are sometimes qualified to operate in a lab. Good, i might need some physicists in the lab depending on their specialties. An electrician is always useful, or somebody trained in electrochemistry or optics, for example. Moreover experiments also need calibrations, and here sometimes experienced specialists are required. \n",

We see finally a solution to the same problems that Bohr to Sommerfeld to Heisenberg to Schrodinger all confronted but counld not resolve. In this path the _quantum_ is unnecessary hypothesis. For recall that Planck introduced the quantum as a hypothesis to explain his formula for relating temperature to the spectrum of blackbody radiatio, and he had no explanation for it And its caused no small amount of trouble for the 20th century. What if the quantum discontinuity could finally be understood in the classical continuity? \n",

        "So why do i want to run a lab? Because i want to be positioned to lead the way, be among the shock troops of this new frontier of electrical physics. But it remains something of an obscure path, but which is becoming clearer. There is opportunity to become a pioneer and build the trail, and to document the route. And i'm not the first, but i feel like the first wave who've learned from Electric Universe and Thunderbolts Project, and picking up the tradition left from Wilhelm Weber.\n",

Using Weber's notation, we imagine the electron with charge $-1$ being a three-body system, namely $$[+1, -1, -1].$$ Here the $+1$ refers to a positron core, while we have two $-1$ charges in orbit. Now we can either have the $-1$ charges isolated, or we can imagine the $-1$ charges being within the Weber critical radius such that $[-1, -1]$ is a stable two-body system, i.e. within the critical radius the $-1$ charges are mutually attractive (!). Thus the electron can be more aptly modelled as $$[+1, [-1, -1]], $$ or sometimes written $$[+1, -2].$$ In otherwords, we do not really allow a point with charge $-2$, but rather two distinct $-1$ charge particles which have passed the critical radius and are now a stable attractive two body system. From afar such a two-body system $[-1, -1]$ could be seen to approximate the one-body system $[-2]$. \n",
