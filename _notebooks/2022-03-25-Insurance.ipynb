Insurance policies are wagers about future-costs of variable goods and services. A profitable insurance policy requires accurate forecasts of expected future costs. Moreover the distribution of these losses and events need to be reasonably non-correlated. This is the difficult with insuring houses in flood zones, since a flood typically floods _all_ the houses in a given region, and not a house \"here and there\". On the other hand, house fires don't typically affect multiples houses at once (although fires ``spread\" of course).\n",

Their value largely emerges from this interconnection, therefore the analysis of risk and potential losses must take into account the inter-dependencies between connected nodes. Second, most ICT resources are universal automatons and thus have a dual nature: if operational,they generate value for its operators and therefore become loss sources when they malfunction; moreover, when abused or “taken over” by malicious attackers, benign nodes can become threats to other nodes.\" \n",

In contrast to the property and liability category it is notable that cyber risk is a mixture of short- and long-tail risks, which can be of a first- and third-party nature. Cyber risk thus is a combination of both categories. In contrast to the terror and cat risk one striking result is that cyber is a low frequency/high severity risk with respect to extreme scenarios, but it also has a high frequency component, which we could call the cyber risks “of daily life” (e.g., hacker attacks).
