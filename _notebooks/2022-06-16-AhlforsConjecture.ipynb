        "A recent [MO post](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/424343/counterexamples-to-the-ahlfors-measure-conjecture-in-higher-dimensions) has prompted us to express something about our views regarding $\\Gamma$ actions and $\\Gamma$-invariant Borel measures and proper discontinuous actions, $E\\Gamma$ spaces, etc.. The conjecture is rather famous, especially in three dimensions. But since our PhD thesis (2019) we have some nonstandard approaches to the problem, which we will elaborate below.\n",

        "It's not easy to describe the current state of the conjecture, depending on several implications and reductions to other conjectures, especially in three-dimensions. A good reference is [here](http://www.numdam.org/item/PMIHES_2003__98__145_0/). \n",

        "The setting for Ahlfor's problem begins with a discrete finitely generated group $\\Gamma < Isom(\\bf{H}^{n+1})$ of some hyperbolic space. The discreteness of the group representation implies that $\\Gamma$ acts _proper discontinuously_ on the hyperbolic space. The hyperbolic space also has a canonical volume measure. We say the representation has finite covolume if the quotient $\\bf{H} /\\Gamma$ has finite volume. In otherwords $\\Gamma$ represents the fundamental group of a hyperbolic orbifold $X:=\\bf{H}^{n+1} / \\Gamma$, and the action $$\\Gamma \\times \\bf{H}^{n+1} \\to \\bf{H}^{n+1}$$ is the universal covering action $$\\pi_1 \\times \\tilde{X} \\to \\tilde{X} $$ where $\\tilde{X}\\approx \\bf{H}^{n+1}$. \n",

        "We need carefully define the topology to properly define the _limit points_ $L_\\Gamma$ of a $\\Gamma$-orbit $\\Gamma.pt$. In fact some confusion arises because the topology on the visual sphere at-infinity is not always made explicit by authors. Naively the majority definition of the topology on the visual sphere consists of open subsets which are _presumed_ to contain ideal points $\\xi$ at infinity. This perspective implicitly assumes that the boundary disk is the natural compactification of the hyperbolic space $\\bf{H}$. \n",
        "\n",
        "But actually the correct definition of these ideal points is via horoballs and the horofunctions. A point at-infinity $\\xi$ really corresponds to a $1$-Lipschitz function $b_\\xi: \\bf{H} \\to \\bf{R}$, and specifically the pole at negative infinity $-\\infty$ of $b_\\xi$. The level sets of the horofunction $b_\\xi$ are horospheres centred at $\\xi$. \n",

        "\n",
        "1. Horofunction definition of limit points at-infinity: the point $\\xi$ is a limit point of the orbit $\\Gamma .pt$ with respect to the horoball topology if the values of the orbit $b_\\xi(\\gamma.pt)$, $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, accumulate near the negative infinity pole. I.e. iff there exists an infinite subsequence such that $b_\\xi(\\gamma.pt)$ diverges to $-\\infty$.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"Open\" topology definition of limit points: the visual point $\\xi' \\in \\partial_\\infty \\bf{H}$ is a limit point of the orbit $\\Gamma .pt$ w.r.t. the open topology if every open neighborhood $U$ of $\\xi'$ in $\\bf{H} \\cup \\partial_\\infty \\bf{H}$ has a non trivial intersection with the orbit $U \\cap \\Gamma.pt \\neq \\emptyset$. \n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with the second definition, which admittedly the majority topology in the literature, is that the point at-infinity has not been defined, and no criteria is given for testing whether the \"point\" $\\xi'$ is contained or not contained in the open subset $U$ of $\\bf{H}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore in the horofunction topology, the ideal points at-infinity are not \"points on a sphere\" they are instead $1$-Lipschitz functions obtained as a natural limit of the distance functions $d(x,y)$. The point at infinity $\\xi$ is instead the negative infinity pole of the corresponding horofunction $b_\\xi$.\n",

        "One method of topologizing the boundary is via the visual angle metric. Another interesting topology on the boundary is the Busemann topology.

The sphere at-infinity does not have a $\\Gamma$-invariant metric since $\\Gamma$ actions by translating the basepoint $pt$. It is a standard fact that the sphere at-infinity has a well-defined $\\Gamma$-invariant metric modulo quasi-isometries. The definition of quasi-isometries will not be further developed in this article, except to say this: that the topological sphere at-infinity is a difficult object to study with respect to the $\\Gamma$ action. \n",

In other words, if $\\lambda$ is the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure on the topological sphere at-infinity $\\bf{S}^n$, then the only $\\lambda$-measurable $\\Gamma$-invariant functions $f: \\bf{S}^n \\to \\bf{R}$ are constant a.e.. [Insert reference to Mostow's proof, or Thurston's book]. Roughly speaking, the topological $\\Gamma$-action on $\\bf{S}^n$ is very complicated, acting with sources and sinks and strange dynamics which are not measured by the $n$-dimensional Lebesge measure $\\lambda$. \n",

        "To finally state Ahlfor's measure conjecture we need to define the limit set of a $\\Gamma$-orbit. Informally we can define $L_\\Gamma \\subset \\partial_\\infty \\bf{H}$ as the accumulation points of the orbit $\\Gamma. pt$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ahlfor's Measure Conjecture: If $\\Gamma, X$ satisfy the assumptions (i) and (ii), namely having finitely many ends and finite volume, then the limit set $L_\\Gamma$ is either a zero or full measure subset of $\\partial_\\infty \\tilde{X}$. In otherwords, the limit set $L_\\Gamma$ is either equal to $\\bf{S}^n$ or has vanishing $n$-dimensional measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most circumstances, the action of $\\Gamma$ on the visual sphere is ergodic with respect to the natural Lebesgue measure on the sphere. However the example in the above MO post shows the action is not necessarily ergodic in higher dimensions for certain groups. However in this counter-example to ergodicity the group $\\Gamma$ is finitely-generated but not finitely-presentable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we must admit that the structure of the limit points $L_\\Gamma$ is very difficult to comprehend. Many experts have been involved in producing graphics and simulations of these limit sets, especially for Kleinian and Fuchsian groups. Mumford's book \"Indra's Pearls\" is also relevant here. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Now our approach to Ahlfor's Measure Conjecture is to first realize that the visual boundary is not the correct boundary for the group action $\\Gamma \\times \\bf{H} \\to \\bf{H}$. We view the visual boundary as extremely unnatural with respect to the group $\\Gamma$. Specifically, the problem is that the $\\Gamma$ action is not proper discontinuous on the visual sphere. This means that point orbits on the sphere are not well separated by the $\\Gamma$ action. In otherwords, the visual boundary is very confusing because group elements which otherwise are very distinct can have similar actions on the visual boundary, and their distinct identities become confused. \n"
