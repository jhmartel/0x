        "> \"JHM Labs has been working intensively on Weber, but we briefly return to the problem of Closing Steinberg on the mapping class group of hyperbolic surfaces. In this post we comment on the technical lemma which is delaying our progress. The question is: How does one really decide whether curves in the universal cover project to _simple_ closed curves? Or equivalently, How to decide when the $G$ translates of a doubly ended infinite geodesic $\\ell$ are _disjoint_ in the universal cover? \" \n",
