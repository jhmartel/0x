        "# How to Decide when Curves Self Intersect in the Universal Cover\n",
        "\n",
        "> \"JHM Labs has been working intensively on Weber, but we briefly return to the problem of Closing Steinberg on the mapping class group of hyperbolic surfaces. In this post we comment on the technical lemma which is delaying our progress. The question is ... How does one really decide whether curves in the universal cover project to simple closed curves, with emphasis on simple? Or equivalently ... How to decide when the $G$ translates of a doubly ended infinite geodesic $\\ell$ are disjoint in the universal cover? This is interesting decision problem, and serves as the prototype of a more general problem related to applications of solutions to Closing Steinberg.\" \n",
