        "For example, you might have a bug who lives on the vertices $A,B,C,D$ of a tetrahedron. The bug moves randomly from vertex $A$ to vertices $B,C,D$; and from those vertices the bug moves randomly again. So what is the probability that after five steps, the bug begins at $A$ and terminates at $A$ ? \n",

        "If $X_t$ is the random variable which is the vertex position of the bug after $t$ time steps, then we seek $P(X_4=A | X_0=A)$. I.e. we have the initial condition $X_0=A$. (Notice the time-step index is shifted by -1). This is known as a basic Markov process with probability transition matrix $$A:=\\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",

        "The desired probability $P(X_4=A | X_0=A)$ is then related to the entries of $A^4$, or more specifically, the product $$e_1. A^4. ({}^t e_1).$$ In coordinates this term is equal to the $(1,1)$ entry in the matrix $A^4$. We had a pencil and paper so we computed the first two powers, guessed a recursive formula, then picked the nearest multiple choice answer."
