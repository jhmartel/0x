        "\n",
        "Ampere's investigations in 1820-1826 led to his proposing a force law between two current elements $I_1 ds_1$ and $I_2 ds_2$. The current element has a scalar $I$ which represents the net current intensity, and $ds$ is a differential vector element representing arc length along the circuit. The magnitude of $I$ typically represents the *current intensity*, while the magnitude of $ds$ represents the *current velocity*. \n",

        "Ampere determined that the force between two current elements was radial and proportional to the current intensity and to current velocities. Thus the force $F$ was proportional to $I_1 I_2 ds_1 ds_2$. Ampere discovered the inverse square distance proportionality. And moreover determined the precise coefficient of proportionality. Thus in cgs units Ampere's force law is expressed:\n",

Historically one finds that Ampere's force law differs from Grassmann's proposed force law by an exact differential, hence the integrals over closed curves coincide. [ref: Assis].

But of course, $B$ properly defined depends on a choice of *test* charge, i.e. $B$ represents an amount of force that would be exerted on the test charge *if* that charge was located at $x$.

        " Weber proposed that every current element $I d \\ell $ was equal to some amount of charge in motion, something like $I d\\ell = q v$ or $I d\\ell = \\sum q_i v_i$. Weber assumed [ref] that the current elements consisted of a combination of charge-velocities whose total electrical charge was zero $\\sum q_i=0$ for each current element. The net zero electric charge for each current element still leaves the velocities of the charges independant from one another. If one assumes that $I d\\ell$ is a sum of $v_+$ and $v_-$ particles with charges $q_+ + q_-=0$. \n"
