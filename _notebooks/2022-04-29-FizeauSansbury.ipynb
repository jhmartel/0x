When the light pulse was blocked at the photodiode during the time of emission, but unblocked at the expected time of arrival, $31.2$ nanoseconds after the beginning of the time of emission, for $15$ nanosecond duration, little light was received. (A little more than the $4mV$ noise on the oscilloscope). This process was repeated thousands of times per second._\n",

So Sansbury's experiment appears to have not been sufficiently investigated, and we would argue that the experiment has neither been reproduced nor properly reviewed. Thus we turn to the classical Fizeau experiment, and consider its similarities to Sansbury's setup.\n",

        "Now Fizeau's original setup is a type of Sansbury test where the wheel is in uniform motion. Sansbury's setup involves either a wheel in _nonuniform_ motion, or equivalently a wheel in uniform motion with a nonuniform sawtooth distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "We remark that Fizeau was historically looking to estimate the luminal velocity $c$. Sansbury's experiment assumes $c$ as given, estimated at $1$ foot per nanosecond. Sansbury's goal is to distinguish light propagation from particle model, and his setup is meant to test whether light is even something that travels at all. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose we have Fizeau's apparatus setup, with the 720 saw teeth on the wheel, and with angular velocity $\\omega$ such that the wheel in continuous uniform motion with velocity $\\omega$ blocks out all light. Fizeau would conclude that the time required for the wheel to turn one saw tooth was equal to the light's return trip time. \n",
        "\n",
        "Sansbury's __(Case 1)__ could be realized if the wheel was allowed to rotate nonuniformly, i.e. if the wheel could be accelerated in \"impulses\" something closer to the actual discrete motions of a clock. For example, if the wheel is initially opened at the time of emission, then immediately rotated one saw tooth length (to the closed position) during the expected time of travel, and just prior to the expected time of arrival is rotated another tooth length (to the open position), then Fizeau would predict that the receiver would observe a strong light source. However Sansbury predicts that the receiver would observe rather a very weak signal. Notice, here we require the wheel to move twice as fast as Fizeau's angular velocity. In otherwords the wheel must rotate two complete tooth lengths before the estimated arrival time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sansbury's __(Case 2)__ could be realized if the wheel was rotating _discontinuously_. For example, if we keep the wheel fixed during the expected time of flight of the light particle, and turn the wheel one complete toothlength at the expected time of arrival, then Sansbury would predict a relatively strong signal would be received. Fizeau and the particle model would however predict no light would be received, since it was essentially blocked by the sawtooth at the expected time of arrival.\n",
