We continue to work on this, although it's admittedly low priority.\n",

We can't help but return to this essay. Again we are looking for Arxiv endorsement so that we may post online. As we review the essay, we are honestly quite pleased with it. There is room to expand on Sansbury-Fizeau spinning sawtooth experiment. But I think we have succeeded in representing our viewpoint on the SR controversy. There ___are___ mathematical errors in the _foundations_ of SR.\n",

And the question arises: _\"What are we doing today that's going to make tomorrow different?\"_ More to the point, _\"What am i doing today that's going to bring me somewhere new next year?_\" I'm getting ___old___, so _what am I doing? Where am I going?_\n",

The problem is: _How to recycle Lithium ion batteries?_ Obviously I don't know. But is there an opportunity for a mathematician physicist to make some progress on the problem? Maybe. But all that takes time. \n",
