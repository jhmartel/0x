        "# A Different Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "Ok we have not posted in a week. Why? Because another project has emerged in JHM Labs. Quite simply, we are going to make jewellery like silver and gold rings. This is something we can't _talk_ about, because we need to _do_. So I cannot open my mouth until I have a custom silver ring on my hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the pitch: Jewellry stores suck! They have terrible selection, ugly designs, and are operating in the past. It's amazing how many of them occupy shopping malls, which means they're expensive and operating at huge budgets. But they don't seem popular ... \n",
        "\n",
        "So what is the modern form of jewellry shop? Here we imagine that everybody should be able to have exactly what they want as a ring or piece of jewellry. Why? Because casting jewellry is simple enough, requiring  either a 3D wax model or a negative plaster mould in which the molten metal is poured and cast. We assume this process is standardized. What we need to solve is the problem of generating the 3D code, in other words, virtualizing the idea. This problem has many aspects, but the opportunity is if anybody proposes an image, an idea, then we produce the 3D code required to put the object into production.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now traditionally we might handcarve a single model from wax, then virtualize, then mass produce either moulds (the negative image) or the wax figure. Our idea is _not_ to handcarve unless absolutely necessary. As much as possible we want to _reproduce_. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here we face a basic startup cost. How to obtain 3D images? Or how to virtualize? If we had 25,000 USD then we yes we could purchase the camera machine. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another idea: don't design anything, just 3D print and scan what we want. So as proof of concept we need to find a 3D figure to scan (or already scanned) and then design into a ring or mould.\n",

        "\n",
        "There is amazing progress with 3D modelling where museums (for example the British Museum) makes high quality 3D scans of artifacts. Our special interest is jewellery. Therefore in principle we could be making _reproductions_ of antique rings, etc.. This is part of our idea that we shouldn't really design anything, but rather reproduce and recreate. \n",

        "\n",
        "We are also reflecting on the geometry of rings. Of course it's a simple design, but how do we really create beautiful rings? Here the 3D modelling is challenging, because we need to explicitly create these elegant rings from poly structures, and are not exactly capable of designing the rings from _equations_. "
