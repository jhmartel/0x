            "content": "Here we examine Phipp&#39;s potential $P= frac{1}{r} sqrt{1- frac{r&#39;}{c}}$. It&#39;s clear that Phipp&#39;s potential imposes an upper bound on the velocities of particles in free fall relative to $P$. But while Phipp&#39;s potential guarantees subluminal velocities, it does not appear to satisfy a conservation of energy, and the quantity $T+P$ is not constant along trajectories. . The Phipp potential can induce negative effective mass at small distances, similar to the case of Weber&#39;s potential. However the critical radius depends on the relative velocity of the particles. By contrast Weber&#39;s critical radius depends only on the mass $m$ and $c^2$. . These two facts are demonstrated in the cells below, and demonstrates some severe disadvantages to Phipp&#39;s potential. We are therefore inclined to investigate Weber&#39;s potential as a model of electrodynamics. . from sympy import * t=symbols(&#39;t&#39;) m=symbols(&#39;m&#39;) c=symbols(&#39;c&#39;) r=Function(&#39;r&#39;)(t) P=Function(&#39;P&#39;)(r,t) F=Function(&#39;F&#39;)(r,t) P=(r**-1)*sqrt(1-r.diff(t)/c) F=(-1)*(P.diff(t))*((r.diff(t))**-1) pprint(simplify(P)) print() pprint(simplify(F)) ## symbolic computation of the Force law. . ______________ ╱ d ╱ c - ──(r(t)) ╱ dt ╱ ──────────── ╲╱ c ──────────────────── r(t) 2 d r(t)⋅───(r(t)) 2 ⎛ d ⎞ d dt ⎜c - ──(r(t))⎟⋅──(r(t)) + ────────────── ⎝ dt ⎠ dt 2 ──────────────────────────────────────── ______________ ╱ d ╱ c - ──(r(t)) ╱ dt 2 d c⋅ ╱ ──────────── ⋅r (t)⋅──(r(t)) ╲╱ c dt . import numpy as np from scipy.integrate import odeint, solve_ivp import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D m=0.5 ## mass of second test particle c=1.0 ## speed of light constant in Weber&#39;s potential ## Kinetic Energy: we use the naive expression for vis viva.

Presently BoC estimates that only 5 per cent of Canadians have BTC (this is surely an underestimate), so there appears to be relatively small demand for cryptocurrencies, and almost zero demand for central bank digital currencies. . Personally, a person might be willing to invest in digital yuan, say, in the prospect of that foreign currency being backed by hard money gold reserves. But any foreign holder of digital yuan (especially at this relatively early stage) is subject to a large amount of spam, and inquiries, and phishing emails. In otherwords, acquiring the digital yuan comes with a diminished privacy and/or anonymity. This is something of a liability to the foreign holder of digital yuan. . We observe that the central banks, and specifically BoC, are keen to distinguish their CBDC&#39;s from the general cryptocurrencies.

This has various motivations, e.g. branding and marketing to control public opinion, but it&#39;s also an important technical distinction, for the CBDC will be strongly centralized with the BoC. . How? . Let&#39;s comment on centralized versus decentralized currencies. The decentralization in crypto refers to various properties of the networks. First, it refers to the fact that transactions can be confirmed by any node that either solves the nonce problem (in PoW) or is randomly elected (where the random choice is decentrally chosen). . In BTC&#39;s original design, there was an anti-inflationary mechanism, namely in the &quot;halving&quot; principle and miner rewards. The miners expend the energy and invest in the IT infrastructure to send and receive and confirm transactions in the ledger, and in most cases, the miner&#39;s receive token rewards for these services. Eventually, I think it&#39;s approximately 2150 AD, the miners will not receive any BTC rewards, and there will be a strict fee structure. I don&#39;t think anybody has any idea whether this will sufficiently motivate miners to preserve the integrity of the ledger, i.e. it might become more profitable to destroy the record of the ledger. . There are differences between proof-of-work (like original BTC) or proof-of-stake (like ETH, or ADA). But the point is that tokens are issued as rewards for miners and nodes. The various cryptocurrencies have different governance policies for how tokens are distributed, to prevent monetary inflation. This is indeed one of the standard arguments in favour of BTC as &quot;perfect money&quot; (although we don&#39;t necessarily agree with Saylor, Keiser, Breedlove, et.al. that BTC is &quot;perfect&quot; money.) . The Bank Of Canada has a monopoly on printing currency (i.e. fiat dollar bills, or electronic money), and it&#39;s extremely unlikely that they will surrender this monopoly in their CBDC.

This is one reason why BoC cannot allow cryptocurrencies to compete with BoC&#39;s dollar. If people flee the Canadian dollar, then the main tool and mandate of the BoC (control of monetary supply) is annulled. . So we can assume that the goal of the CBDC is to have tokens which can only be issued by the centralized authority of BoC. This suggests that BoC will either develop their own network for CBDC transactions (extremely unlikely, i think), or they will attempt to build their token on top of another pre-existing network.

            "title": "Closing Steinberg, Part 1. Mapping Class Group",
            "content": "We present the formal definition of Closing Steinberg symbols. . Let $ Gamma$ be a group acting on a space $X$ by group action $X times Gamma to X$. If $P subset X$ is a subset of $X$, then a finite subset $I$ of $ Gamma$ is said to formally close $P$ if the iterated symmetric difference of $ { gamma. P ~|~ gamma in I }$ vanishes (equal to empty set $ emptyset$). . N.B. The vanishing of the iterated symmetric difference means the chain sum $ gamma.P$, for $ gamma in I$, vanishes over mod 2 coefficients. I.e. every element in the $I$-translates of $P$ occurs an even number of times. . The above is the abstract formulation of a problem we call Closing the Steinberg symbol. In our applications the subset $P$ is a panel representing the convex hull of a sphere at infinity which is called the &quot;Steinberg symbol&quot;. . Now the key to Closing Steinberg (CS) is to find nontrivial formal solutions. We will illustrate with the specific group $ Gamma = Mod(S)$ which is the mapping class group of a compact hyperbolic surface $S$. We will begin with genus $g(S)=2$. . Now we introduce the basic functions using Mark C. Bell&#39;s curver: . Now we make the basic definitions of the reference pant, and the mapping class elements $ zeta, nu, mu$. . pant={a,b,c} ## pant={a,b,c} is the standard pant. zeta=a*e*c*f*b ## zeta is the order 6 element in MCG arising from chain relation. ## nu=a*e*c*f ## nu is order 10 element in MCG mu=nu**4 ## mu is order 5 element in MCG. . We define $ xi$ as the union of the standard pair of pants with its $ mu$-translate. The $ mu$-translate of $ {a,b,c }$ is a pair of pants dual to $ {a,b,c }$. . The mapping class element $ mu$ is an order 5 element in $Mod(S_2)$. We propose that the powers of $ mu$, namely $I= {Id, mu, mu^2, mu^3, mu^4 }$, formally close the symbol $ xi$. This solution will be nontrivial because we will establish that $ mu^i xi = mu^j xi$ if and only if $i=j$. Thus the $I$-translates of $ xi$ are distinct, while the chain sum $ sum_{i=0}^4 mu^i xi$ vanishes over ${ bf{Z}}/2$ coefficient. . ## xi is obtained by joining the initial pant p with its mu translate. xi=pant|Translate(mu, pant) ## important to verify that pant and the mu-translate are disjoint. ## Ad(mu,pant) is &quot;opposite pair of pants&quot; print(&quot;The mu translate of the standard pant is disjoint from pant. &quot;, pant &amp; Translate(mu, pant) == set()) print() M0=xi M1=Translate(mu,xi) M2=Translate(mu**2,xi) M3=Translate(mu**3,xi) M4=Translate(mu**4,xi) ## The following proves that all the symbol translates are nontrivial, and there is no complete coincidence ## between the translated symbols. print(&quot;The mu translates of xi are all pairwise distinct:&quot;, M0!=M1 and M0!=M2 and M0!=M3 and M0!=M4 and M1!=M2 and M1!=M3 and M1!=M4 and M2!=M3 and M2!=M4 and M3!=M4 ) print() ## The following proves that the total chain sum of the translated symbols vanishes mod 2. ## I.e. the iterated symmetric difference of the translated symbols is equal to empty set. print(&quot;The iterated symmetric difference of the mu translates is empty.&quot;, ((((M0^M1))^M2)^M3)^M4 ==set()) print() print(&quot;The mu-orbit of xi is supported on ten curves.&quot;, 10==len(M0|M1|M2|M3|M4) ) print() print(&quot;Therefore we find I={Id, mu, mu**2, mu**3, mu**4} is a formal solution to Closing the Steinberg symbol xi in genus two.&quot;) print(&quot;&quot;) . The mu translate of the standard pant is disjoint from pant. True The mu translates of xi are all pairwise distinct: True The iterated symmetric difference of the mu translates is empty. True The mu-orbit of xi is supported on ten curves. True Therefore we find I={Id, mu, mu**2, mu**3, mu**4} is a formal solution to Closing the Steinberg symbol xi in genus two. . So we have found a formal solution $I$ to CS. For applications we need further verify that $I$ satisfies further geometric properties. Specifically we need establish: . the $I$-translates of $ xi$ have a well-defined convex hull $F:=conv(I. xi)$ in $Teich(S)$. | the $ Gamma$-translates of $F$ generate a chain sum $ underline{F}:= sum_{ gamma in Gamma} gamma.F$ with well separated gates equal to the $ Gamma$-translates of $ xi$. | . Informally the idea is that $ xi$ represents a &quot;panel&quot; $P$, and $I$ closes the panel in the sense that the $I$-translates of the panel assemble to a closed ball. (Similar to how the (triangular, hexagonal) panels of a soccer ball assemble to form the closed ball). . But we must further study the $ Gamma$-translates of the ball itself, i.e. of the convex hull $F$. Most important for our setting is that the intersections of the various translates $ gamma F cap gamma&#39; F$ have a &quot;standard form&quot;, namely isometric to $ xi$ (the panel $P$). . Remark. It&#39;s not clear whether the above verification of ``well-separated gates&quot; can be performed in curver. While we are capable of considering the $ Gamma$ action on the elements of $I. xi$, we cannot necessarily compute the intersections $F cap gamma F$. The issue is that $F cap gamma F$ can intersect &quot;at-infinity&quot; (i.e. be asymptotic) without the convex hulls having an intersection in the interior of $Teich(S)$. Formally the solutions to CS solve a problem at infinity, but the next step is to study the solutions in the interior, and this becomes more geometric. .",

            "content": "Einstein SR and Maxwell . The history of special relativity (SR) arose out of Einstein&#39;s study (1900+) of Maxwell equations (1870).But what is the logical and mathematical relation between SR and Maxwell? . Briefly, by Maxwell equations we understand that in a given reference frame $K$ we have the existence of electric and magnetic fields $E,B$ satisfying [equations]. What are $E,B$? [insert] . Composing the first-order Maxwell equations yields the second-order fact that the coordinate components of $E,B$ satisfy wave equations with speed of propagation $c= sqrt{ epsilon_0 mu_0}$. This usually leads to the idea that electromagnetic field disturbances travel at the speed of $c$ in ether. And indeed Maxwell equations expressly assume an aether, or the medium by the which the wave energy travels. . The null result of the Michelson-Morley experiments led to Einstein&#39;s postulating the Lorentz transformations relating space and time variables $x,t$. . The classical homogeneous wave equation has the property of the velocity being dependant on the receiver velocity relative to the medium. But SR argues that the assumption (A12) on the &quot;rectilinear uniform propagation of light&quot; somehow yields a wave equation where velocity is receiver independant. But how? . So what have we shown? That the Minkowski line element $ds^2$ is dual to d&#39;Alembert $ square$, and if light is assumed to propagate according to $ds^2=0$, then [incomplete]. . For example, the quadratic form representing $ds^2$ satisfies $ square h=0$ where $h=-c^2t^2+ frac{1}{3}(x^2+y^2+z^2)$. . Now Einstein&#39;s (A12) postulates the uniform rectilinear propagation of light in vacuum. This would suggest a corpuscular model of light, being represented as affine parameterized lines $$s mapsto (s, x(s), y(s), z(s))=(s, gamma(s)) $$ in ${ bf{R}}^{3,1}$ satisfying $D^2_{ss} gamma =0$. . Is the equation $D^2_{ss} gamma=0$ Lorentz covariant? (Yes?) . But what are the corresponding &quot;uniform rectilinear&quot; solutions $ phi$ for the dual HWE: $~~ square phi=0$ ? This would be a Lorentz invariant class of solutions $ { phi }$ of the HWE which have [incomplete: some uniform and rectilinear characteristics]. . Compare https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Spherical_Waves_Point_Source.html . Concluding idea: there has always been correspondance between lines in $V$ (one-dimensional linear subspaces) and quadratic functionals via the Segre embedding, or $ lambda mapsto lambda^2$ where $ lambda in V^*$ is a linear functional. . The following questions will be answered below: . Are the quadratic functions $q(x)=h(v,x)^2/2$ solutions to $ square =0$ for null vector $v in N$? . | Can we find quadratic functions $q$ whose level sets are everywhere orthogonal to the null cone $N$ ? . | . The idea would be to derive some canonical solutions $ square q=0$ from quadratics arising from vectors on the null cone. . If $v$ belongs to null cone, then $q(x):=h(v,x)^2/2$ for $x in V$ defines a quadratic function on $V$ with $q(v)=h(v,v)^2=0$. It&#39;s clear that $q$ is minimized along $v^ perp$, and that $v in v^ perp$. Moreover the differential of $q(x)=q(t,x)$ satisfies $dq|_x=h(v,x)v$. . Lemma. For every vector $v in { bf{R}}^{3,1}$, let $q(x):=h(v,x)^2/2$ be the quadratic form defined by $v$. Then $ square q=0$ if and only if $v in N$ and $h(v,v)=0$. . Proof. We claim that $ square q=h(v,v)$ when $q(u)=h(v,u)^2/2$. . If the vector $v$ has coordinates $v=[v_t, v_x, v_y, v_z]$, then $h(v,x)^2$ is equal to $$(-v_t t + v_xx+ v_yy+ v_zz)^2,$$ which is equal to $$v_t^2 t^2 +v_x^2 x^2 + v_y^2 y^2 + v_z^2 z^2 + (mixed~ terms).$$ Therefore applying d&#39;Alembert&#39;s operator we find $$ square q =2( -v_t^2+v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2), $$ since $ square(mixed~~terms)=0$ and the claim follows. . Levi-Civita and Einstein&#39;s Geometric Optics . In Levi-Civita&#39;s &quot;Absolute Differential Calculus&quot;, Einstein&#39;s applications of SR to geometric optics (theory of light propagation) is summarized in two equations. . First we have $$ds^2=0$$ and $$ delta int ds=0.$$ . Here $$ds^2=-c^2 dt^2 + dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$$ is the Lorentzian quadratic form. The Lorentz invariance of $ds^2$ implies the null cone $ds=0$ is Lorentz invariant. . In the second equation $ delta$ is the variational derivative of the functional $ gamma mapsto int_ gamma ds$, and the equation is an expression in the calculus of variations similar to Hamilton&#39;s principle and Fermat&#39;s least time principle. There is a difficulty in reconciling the above equations because the line element $ds$ vanishes identically on the null cone, and therefore the functional $ gamma mapsto int_ gamma ds$ is identically zero on curves $ gamma$ which are everywhere tangent to the null cone. This difficulty is admitted in Levi-Civita&#39;s textbook. More important today is the Lorentz invariance of $ds^2$. . Lorentz Group Actions . Undoubtedly the theory of SR is summarized in the representations of the Lorentz group of linear transformations, namely the isometry group designated $O(ds^2)=O(3,1)$ and its standard linear action on ${ bf{R}}^{3,1}$. . For the mathematician, once a single linear representation is given, there are many algebraic constructions possible to obtain further representations, for example the symmetric and alternating representations. We develop this idea further to try and bridge the assumptions of SR to Maxwell&#39;s equations, and especially the wave equation. . Now we discuss several group representations (i.e. linear group actions). . First we begin with the standard linear representation $$ rho_0:{ bf{R}}^{1,3} times L to { bf{R}}^{1,3}$$ which is the linear representation $ rho_0$ represented by left matrix multiplication $(v, lambda) mapsto lambda.v$. . Next we dualize. . Let $C({ bf{R}}^{3,1})$ be the space of polynomial functions on the space. Abbreviate $C:=C({ bf{R}}^{3,1})$. Naturally we assemble $C$ from the dual functionals $ lambda in {({ bf{R}}^{3,1})}^*$. Taking products and polynomials in the dual functions $ lambda$ we obtain the contragradient represention $$ rho_0^*:C( { bf{R}}^{3,1}) times L to C({ bf{R}}^{3,1}). $$ . The idea is that the vector spaces $V$ and $V^*$ are isomorphic (non canonically) in finite dimensions. Moreover the algebra generated by $V^*$ yields an (infinite-dimensional) space of polynomial functions on $V$. . Now what are vector fields? . In differential topology, the vector fields $ frac{ partial }{ partial x}$ act on functions as a derivation, i.e. as linear maps $$ frac{ partial }{ partial x}: C to C $$ satisfying Liebniz product formula. Iterating the derivations $ frac{ partial }{ partial x} circ frac{ partial }{ partial y}= frac{ partial^2 }{ partial x partial y}$ leads to the usual differential operators, etc.. . Consider the d&#39;Alembert operator $$ square:= frac{-1}{c^2} frac{ partial^2}{ partial t^2} + frac{ partial^2}{ partial x^2}+ frac{ partial^2}{ partial y^2}+ frac{ partial^2}{ partial z^2} .$$ . Now our main proposal is that the Minkowski squared line element $ds^2$ is dual in a linear algebraic sense to the d&#39;Alembert operator $ square$. . The Lorentz invariance of $ square$ shows the solutions to the homogeneous wave equation (HWE) are Lorentz covariant and $ square phi =0$ if and only if $ square lambda cdot phi =0$ for every Lorentz transformation $ lambda in L$. The corresponding fact for $ds^2$ is that the null cone $ds^2=0$ is Lorentz covariant. . # .",

            "content": ". Today we begin the study of Weber&#39;s potential in the isolated two-body system consisting of an electron and positron pair $e^-$ and $e^+$. We assume the particles $e^ pm$ have equal mass $m=m_{e^{ pm}}$. The reduced mass is concentrated at the centre-of-mass $ mu=m/2$. . Weber&#39;s force is attractive between the pair $e^ pm$ at all distances. . The particles $e^ pm$ do not indefinitely spiral inwards. Simulations indicate that the radial distance between $e^ pm$ stays strictly bounded between two upper and lower limits $$0 &lt; r_{lower} leq r leq r_{upper} &lt; + infty .$$ This is rigorously proved in Weber-Clemente, 1990.pdf). . If the electron is indivisible particle, then the above two-body problem models a pair $e^-$ and $e^+$ of isolated electron and positron. . But do the particles $e^ pm$ ever &#39;collide&#39; and annihalate? . In the standard physics textbooks, it seems well known that annihalation between $e^ pm$ occurs and two gamma rays are ejected in opposite directions when $e^ pm$. conserving momentum, etc., and converting all their mass into energy. Thus it&#39;s determined that two gamma rays of energy $0.511 keV$ are released, where Einstein&#39;s formula $E=m_ec^2$ is applied, where $m_e$ is the reduced mass. [ref] The annihalation of $e^ pm$ is apparently an experimental test of the validity of Einstein&#39;s &quot;mass-energy&quot; hypothesis. . But what does Weber&#39;s potential say about the annihalation of $e^+$ and $e^-$ ? . If we know the centre of mass has zero net force, then we can replace the positions $r_1$, $r_2$ of the particles by their relative distance $r_{12}$ from the centre of mass. This yields $$r_1=R + frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2} r_{12}$$ and $$r_2=R - frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2} r_{12}.$$ . Applying Newton&#39;s Second Law that $F_{21}=-F_{12}$ yields the following equation for $r_{12}&#39;&#39;$: $$ mu . r_{12}&#39;&#39; = F_{21},$$ where $ mu$ is the reduced mass of the system, namely $ mu= frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}=0.5$. . In the following equations we use numpy.odeint to solve Weber equations of motion of the relative distance $r_{12}$. Therefore we have reduced the two-body problem to a one-body problem. This is a standard reduction. . Given the solution for $r_{12}$, how do we reconstruct the paths/positions of the particles $r_1$, $r_2$ ? Answer: via the relation $r_1=R+ frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2} r_{12}$ and $r_2=R- frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}r_{12}$. . Now the relative distance $r_{12}$ is a type of radial distance, and if $r, omega$ is spherical coordinates, then we have $$r&#39;^2=|v|^2= x&#39;^2+y&#39;^2+z&#39;^2=(r&#39;)^2+r^2 ( theta&#39;)^2. $$ The above formula is the usual $|v|^2=v_r^2+v_t^2$, and the tangent velocity $v_t$ satisfies $v_t=r theta&#39;$, where $ theta&#39;$ is the angular velocity. . The conservation of angular momentum says that the angular moment $L= mu r times v$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of $r$, is constant along the motion. Moreover one has $$|L|= mu r^2 theta&#39;.$$ Thus we find the formula $$ theta&#39;= frac{|L|}{ mu r^2}.$$ This implies $$T= frac{ mu}{2}v^2= frac{ mu}{2}[(r&#39;)^2+ frac{|r times v|^2}{r^{2}}]$$ represents the kinetic energy of the system. . The conservation of energy says $T+U$ is constant along trajectories. . # Here we define basic functions. def cross(v1, v2): x1, y1, z1 = v1 x2, y2, z2 = v2 return [y1*z2 - z1*y2, -(x1*z2 - z1*x2), x1*y2 - y1*x2 ] def rho(rel_position): x,y,z = rel_position return (x*x+y*y+z*z)**0.5 def dot(vector1, vector2): x1, y1, z1 = vector1 x2, y2, z2 = vector2 return x1*x2+y1*y2+z1*z2 def rdot(position, vector): return dot(position, vector)/rho(position) def norm(rel_velocity): return rho(rel_velocity) mu=0.5 ## reduced mass of the system.

            "title": "One-Dimensional Ampere Force",
            "content": ". One-Dimensional Ampere . We continue with our discussion of Ampere&#39;s force, and consider the special case where the current elements are all pairwise parallel and colinear. In otherwords we assume the current elements belong the a line $ ell$ in $ bf{R}^3$. For simplicity we consider the current elements belonging to the $z$-axis. . The state of a current element on the $z$-axis is then represented by a real-valued function $v(x)$ representing the velocity of the current element. Likewise we interpret $|v(x)|$ as the intensity of the current element. Ampere&#39;s force law in the one-dimensional case then becomes: . $$F_{y ~ text{on}~x} =|v(x)|~|v(y)|~v(x)~v(y) ~ nabla_1 ( frac{1}{r}) . $$ . If we integrate the force $F$ over the entire line we obtain $$F_{ text{current on}~ x} = |v(x)|~ v(x) ~[ nabla_1 cdot int dy~ frac{|v(y)| v(y)}{x-y} ]. $$ . The hypothesis of the force being balanced on the line is equivalent to the vanishing $$ nabla_1 ~ int dy frac{|v(y)|~ v(y)}{x-y}= frac{d}{dx} ~ int dy frac{|v(y)|~ v(y)}{x-y}=0 .$$ Equivalently, the force is balanced if the integral $$H(v)(x)=h(x):= int_{- infty}^{+ infty} dy~ frac{|v(y)|~ v(y)}{x-y} $$ is a constant function of $x$ wherever $v(x) neq 0$. . N.B. The integral defining $H(v)$ is taken over the entire real line. We observe that there is no absolute value sign on the denominator $x-y$. This is to include the direction of $ hat{r}$ in the original Ampere law. . Our definition of $H$ is Hilbert&#39;s singular integral transform for real-valued functions. Strictly speaking, the singular integral does not always integrate to a finite number. In the literature, the integral is frequently replaced with a Cauchy principal value. This is related to the function $ frac{1}{y}$ being not absolutely integrable on the real line. However there is sufficient cancellation in the integral to obtain a well-defined principal value. . If the current $v$ is everywhere constant, then symmetry shows the integral $H(v)$ is identically zero, and therefore the total force $F$ of the current is everywhere zero. Therefore we find $v=constant$ is a solution to the balance equation. . N.B. Most discussion of the Hilbert transform is restricted to square-integrable functions on the line $L^2( bf{R})$. On $L^2$ one finds the Hilbert transform defines a unitary operator and is an anti-involution, satisfying $H circ H=-Id$. However the only $L^2$ constant function is the zero function. . Question: Are there any time-independant solutions to the balance equation, i.e. does there exist nonconstant $v in L^ infty( bf{R})$ with $H(v)$ constant? . Question: Can we find time-dependant solutions to the balance equation? I.e. find functions $v_t in L^ infty$ such that $H(v_t)$ is constant for all time $t$. . Remark. The Hilbert transform (modulo homothety) is the only singular operator in one-dimensions which commutes with the affine translation and affine dilatation. This corresponds to the Ampere force commuting with the affine change of variables $x mapsto ax+b$. Since Ampere&#39;s force is relational, it seems proper that the corresponding Hilbert transform also possess these same properties. . Remark. It appears that the only Borel-Radon measures $ mu$ on the real line $ bf{R}$ which have a constant Hilbert transform $H( mu)=c$ are the uniform measures $ mu=const.dy$. If this remains true, then we identify the kernel of $H circ H$ with the uniform measures on $ bf{R}$. .",

            "title": "Weber's Critical Radius, Work, and E=mc2 Formulas",
            "content": ". In the [previous post] we discussed the equations of motion of a charged particle in free fall w.r.t. Weber&#39;s potential $U$. Now we consider the problem of work, and the problem of moving particles &quot;upstream&quot; of the potential. . Recall the Coulomb-type expression that &quot;opposite charges attract&quot; and &quot;like charges repel&quot;. If we arranged some charged particles on a plate, then in a short time these particles would either be repelled outwards to the boundary of the plate or the opposite charges would cancel on the interior. Again this is with respect to the Coulomb model $V(r)=1/r$. . But Weber&#39;s model has the following amazing prediction: &quot;opposite charges attract except at a small critical distance $r=r_c$ where the charges acquires a negative inertial mass and the Weber force becomes repulsive&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;like charges repel except at a small critical distance where the Weber force becomes attractive&quot;. This latter prediction leads to Weber&#39;s *planetary model of the atom&quot;. [Insert ref]. . In the (cgs) units the critical radius $r_c$ is computed as $r_c= frac{1}{m c^2}$ where $m$ is the relative inertial mass of one of the particles. The proof of this formula is an application of Newton&#39;s second law, that $m a = bf{F}$ where $ bf{F}$ is Weber&#39;s force. [insert ref] . Now the question arises: if we have two identical but opposite electrically charged particles, say $(-1)e$ and $(+1)e$, where $e$ is a small mass, then how much work is required to drive $(-1)e$ and $(+1)e$ to within Weber&#39;s critical radius $r_c$? . Weber comments in his final memoir [ref] that an infinite amount of work would be required, however no technical details are provided. In fact this author thinks its evident that a large finite amount of work is required, and the computation of this work required is the subject of this post. . How to compute Work: We imagine a particle moving through a potential $U$ along a trajectory $ gamma.$ Our goal is to determine how much work is required to breach (&quot;pass through&quot;) the critical radius $r_c= frac{1}{mc^2}$ in units where $4 pi epsilon_0 = 1$. . We begin assuming the particle&#39;s trajectory is rectilinear. This means the tangent $ gamma&#39;$ and $ gamma$ are parallel for all values of the parameter. Moreover we can use the Riemannian idea of parameterizing the curve by arclength. Then we ask how much work is required to move the particle through $U$ at a constant rate of speed, namely $|| gamma&#39;||=1$. . Weber&#39;s force is conservative, so there is some path independance, however the terminal conditions are not fixed a priori. It might happen that breaching the Weber radius is easier if the particles velocity is nearly parallel to the &quot;virtual&quot; surface of the Weber&#39;s critical radius. That is to say, the curvature term $r r&#39;&#39;/c^2$ in Weber&#39;s force law might sometimes reduce the work needed, depending on the sign. . In terms of the relational variables recall the useful formula/definition $$ r&#39; = frac{ bf{r} cdot bf{r&#39;}}{r}.$$ In our setting we find $$r&#39;= frac{ gamma cdot gamma&#39;}{|| gamma||}.$$ Applying the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we find $$r&#39;=1.$$ I.e. equality is obtained in Cauchy-Schwartz because $ gamma, gamma&#39;$ are parallel by hypothesis and $|| gamma&#39;||=1$. . Moreover the rectilinear motion implies $r&#39;&#39;=0$, i.e. the trajectory has zero curvature, since the direction of the particle does not change. Therefore Weber&#39;s force leads to work being computed by the integral $$W=(1- frac{1}{2c^2}) int_{+ infty}^{r_c} frac{1}{r^2} dr = (1- frac{1}{2c^2})mc^2=mc^2-m/2.$$ So what is the total energy of the above system? The total energy is the work required $mc^2 - m/2$ plus the initial kinetic energy $T_i=m| gamma&#39;|^2/2=m/2$. Therefore the total energy required to breach the Weber critical radius is $E=W+T_i=mc^2$. . N.B. All the while our particles are &quot;travelling upstream&quot;. So the above computation indicates that if a particle is given sufficient energy (i.e. sufficient kinetic energy, then the particle could breach the Weber critical radius, and arriving at the Weber radius with almost zero kinetic energy). . N.B. The integral representing $W$ is parameterization independant. Therefore the work required by the unit-parameterized path is not overly specialized, but represents the general computation. . The above discussion was restricted to rectilinear trajectories. But the possibility remains that curvilinear (&quot;spiralling&quot;) trajectories require less work to breach the Weber radius. Thus while it appears that breaching the Weber radius via rectilinear paths requires large energy $ approx mc^2$, perhaps the spiralling paths -- where the curvature term maintains a definite sign -- are the more interesting. . Problem: Determine the minimum energy required for an isolated two-body system to breach the Weber critical radius. . Answer: The minimum energy required to breach the critical radius is $E=mc^2$. . This is consequence of the fact that $ bf{F}$ is a conservative force, therefore dependant only on the initial and terminal states, and not the path taken. Moreover the work done by a particle traversing a path $ gamma$ depends only on the difference in potential energies. This implies that the above evaluation in the rectilinear case is essentially the same for all paths from some initial point to to within the critical radius. . Is the energy spectrum within the critical radius continuous? (Yes, i think the orbits can have arbitrary energy within the radius). | How to relate Birkeland currents (FFAC) to Weber&#39;s potential? Don Scott considers the plasma cylinder, with a stead current. Then the min energy state has zero internal pressure, therefore the net internal energy of the plasma cylinder needs be minimized, i.e. vanishing. Difficulty: without the Maxwell equations we do not know relationship between the current flow $I d ell=qdv$. This equality is Weber&#39;s hypothesis, i.e. a current flow is equivalent to a charge in motion, where $dv$ represents the instantaneous velocity of the charged particle. |",

            "content": "Here we examine Phipp&#39;s potential $P= frac{1}{r} sqrt{1- frac{r&#39;}{c}}$. It&#39;s clear that Phipp&#39;s potential imposes an upper bound on the velocities of particles in free fall relative to $P$. But while Phipp&#39;s potential guarantees subluminal velocities, it does not appear to satisfy a conservation of energy, and the quantity $T+P$ is not constant along trajectories. . The Phipp potential can induce negative effective mass at small distances, similar to the case of Weber&#39;s potential. However the critical radius depends on the relative velocity of the particles. By contrast Weber&#39;s critical radius depends only on the mass $m$ and $c^2$. . These two facts are demonstrated in the cells below, and demonstrates some severe disadvantages to Phipp&#39;s potential. We are therefore inclined to investigate Weber&#39;s potential as a model of electrodynamics. . from sympy import * t=symbols(&#39;t&#39;) m=symbols(&#39;m&#39;) c=symbols(&#39;c&#39;) r=Function(&#39;r&#39;)(t) P=Function(&#39;P&#39;)(r,t) F=Function(&#39;F&#39;)(r,t) P=(r**-1)*sqrt(1-r.diff(t)/c) F=(-1)*(P.diff(t))*((r.diff(t))**-1) pprint(simplify(P)) print() pprint(simplify(F)) ## symbolic computation of the Force law. . ______________ ╱ d ╱ c - ──(r(t)) ╱ dt ╱ ──────────── ╲╱ c ──────────────────── r(t) 2 d r(t)⋅───(r(t)) 2 ⎛ d ⎞ d dt ⎜c - ──(r(t))⎟⋅──(r(t)) + ────────────── ⎝ dt ⎠ dt 2 ──────────────────────────────────────── ______________ ╱ d ╱ c - ──(r(t)) ╱ dt 2 d c⋅ ╱ ──────────── ⋅r (t)⋅──(r(t)) ╲╱ c dt . import numpy as np from scipy.integrate import odeint, solve_ivp import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D m=0.5 ## mass of second test particle c=1.0 ## speed of light constant in Weber&#39;s potential ## Kinetic Energy: we use the naive expression for vis viva.

            "content": "2022-02-10-Verifying Conservation of Energy with Python. . Dear Professor Assis, . I am currently studying the Weber potential $U= frac{e_1 e_2}{r} (1- frac{r&#39;^2}{2c^2})$ in python, and specifically looking at the equations of motion of an isolated two-body system. For computation i have chosen one particle to be the origin, and look to solve the equations of motion for the second particle. In computations I take $e_1=e_2=1$ and $c=1$, and the relative mass of the second particle to be $m=0.5$. (Is that mass to small?) . I am fairly confident that I have correctly integrated the equations of motion using python&#39;s odeint. . However I am not able to satisfactorily verify conservation of energy $d(T+U)=0$ along the trajectories, and I am not confident that I have the correct expression for kinetic energy $T$, i use the naive expression $T=mv^2/2$, where $v^2$ is computed in usual way as sum of squares of the velocities of the second particle of mass $m=0.5$. When I use the above expression for $T$ I find the sum $T+U$ is not constant along solutions to the equations of motion $mr&#39;&#39;=ma=F$, where $F=- hat{r} frac{dU}{dr}$ is Weber&#39;s force. .

Expect to see conservation of energy T+U = constant in the second figure. However the sum T+U appears nonconstant. . Discussion: The horizontal axis is the radial distance $r$ from the origin, and the vertical axis is the energy value. We expect the second figure to be a horizontal straight line. It does appear basically flat except for blow-up behaviour at small distance. Perhaps given the relative size of the interval of integration, namely $0.001$, the total energy $T+U$ is constant within error. . Is this loss/gain of energy a defect from the odeint routine?
