            "content": "2022-02-10-Verifying Conservation of Energy with Python. . Dear Professor Assis, . I am currently studying the Weber potential $U= frac{e_1 e_2}{r} (1- frac{r&#39;^2}{2c^2})$ in python, and specifically looking at the equations of motion of an isolated two-body system. For computation i have chosen one particle to be the origin, and look to solve the equations of motion for the second particle. In computations I take $e_1=e_2=1$ and $c=1$, and the relative mass of the second particle to be $m=0.5$. (Is that mass to small?) . I am fairly confident that I have correctly integrated the equations of motion using python&#39;s odeint. . However I am not able to satisfactorily verify conservation of energy $d(T+U)=0$ along the trajectories, and I am not confident that I have the correct expression for kinetic energy $T$, i use the naive expression $T=mv^2/2$, where $v^2$ is computed in usual way as sum of squares of the velocities of the second particle of mass $m=0.5$. When I use the above expression for $T$ I find the sum $T+U$ is not constant along solutions to the equations of motion $mr&#39;&#39;=ma=F$, where $F=- hat{r} frac{dU}{dr}$ is Weber&#39;s force. . From your book on &quot;Relational Mechanics&quot; i understand that kinetic energy is more properly defined as the interaction energy of the particle with the stars at infinity. But is the naive kinetic energy $T=mv^2/2$ the correct expression for the isolated two-body system? . import numpy as np from scipy.integrate import odeint, solve_ivp import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D m=0.5 ## mass of second test particle c=1.0 ## speed of light constant in Weber&#39;s potential ## Kinetic Energy: we use the naive expression for vis viva.

Expect to see conservation of energy T+U = constant in the second figure. However the sum T+U appears nonconstant. . Discussion: The horizontal axis is the radial distance $r$ from the origin, and the vertical axis is the energy value. We expect the second figure to be a horizontal straight line. It does appear basically flat except for blow-up behaviour at small distance. Perhaps given the relative size of the interval of integration, namely $0.001$, the total energy $T+U$ is constant within error. . Is this loss/gain of energy a defect from the odeint routine? In otherwords, is energy not conserved because of cumulative errors and approximations in the solution? . for j in range(50): print( U(result[j,0],result[j,1],result[j,2],result[j,3],result[j,4],result[j,5]) + T(result[j,3], result[j,4], result[j,5]) ) . 0.6813888888888889 0.6816686557880371 0.681949621710001 0.6822317838657116 0.6825151392305971 0.6827996855209162 0.6830854196454909 0.6833723386355962 0.6836604395334028 0.683949719392233 0.6842401752768086 0.6845318042635065 0.6848246035540551 0.6851185704066922 0.6854137019862019 0.685709995468147 0.6860074480391548 0.6863060568971592 0.6866058192516452 0.6869067322696227 0.6872087929447325 0.6875119984287184 0.6878163459034037 0.6881218325625335 0.6884284556120147 0.6887362122701597 0.6890450987325789 0.6893551145542436 0.6896662551800113 0.6899785178581948 0.6902918998406629 0.6906063983829406 0.6909220107443118 0.6912387341879169 0.6915565658811931 0.6918755029226542 0.6921955425346311 0.6925166819411264 0.6928389183668257 0.6931622490371347 0.6934866711782177 0.6938121820170333 0.6941387787813703 0.6944664586998799 0.6947952190021067 0.69512505691852 0.6954559696805385 0.695787954520561 0.6961210086719865 0.6964551293982145 .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
