<h1 id="Closing-Steinberg-Symbols-of-Mapping-Class-Groups-and-Construction-of-Equivariant-Spines-of-Teichmueller-Space-Using-Reduction-To-Singularity-Technique."><em>Closing Steinberg Symbols of Mapping Class Groups and Construction of Equivariant Spines of Teichmueller Space Using Reduction To Singularity Technique.</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Closing-Steinberg-Symbols-of-Mapping-Class-Groups-and-Construction-of-Equivariant-Spines-of-Teichmueller-Space-Using-Reduction-To-Singularity-Technique."> </a></h1><p>This article introduces an algebraic problem we call Closing the Steinberg symbol (CS) of the mapping class group $G=MCG(S)$ of compact hyperbolic surfaces $S=S_g$ for $g\geq 2$.</p>
<p>Solving (CS) requires finding finite subsets $I$ of $G$ which satisfy a subset sum condition, namely that the translates $\sum_{\phi \in I}\phi.B$ of a certain chain sum $B:=\sum_i \alpha_i$ represent a nontrivial homology cycle.</p>
<p>When formal solutions $I$ to (CS) satisfy additional metric convexity properties relative to a geometric model $X:=Teich(S)$ of Teichmueller space, then we obtain an interesting supply of candidate equivariant deformation retracts $X \leadsto Z$ onto subvarieties $Z \hookrightarrow X$. The construction of these retracts and their properties is based on the author's Reduction-to-Singularity method. Thus we examine the problem of Closing Steinberg symbols as an important tool for constructing small dimensional $EG$ models and candidate spines.</p>

<h1 id="Introducing-Mapping-Class-Groups-$G=MCG(S)$-of-Hyperbolic-Surfaces-$S_g$."><em>Introducing Mapping Class Groups</em> $G=MCG(S)$ <em>of Hyperbolic Surfaces</em> $S_g$.<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introducing-Mapping-Class-Groups-$G=MCG(S)$-of-Hyperbolic-Surfaces-$S_g$."> </a></h1><p>Let $S=S_g$ be a closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g \geq 2$. Let $G:=MCG(S)=Mod(S)$ be the mapping class group of $S$.</p>
<p>The topologists define $$MCG(S):=\pi_0(Diff_+(S))$$ as the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $S$ modulo isotopy.</p>
<p>The algebraists define $MCG(S)$ via Dehn-Nielsen-Baer's theorem $$MCG(S)=Out(\pi_1(S))$$ where $\pi_1(S)=\pi_1(S, pt)$ is Poincare's pointed fundamental group.</p>
<p>The choice of definition is a question of taste. We prefer the definition via outer automorphisms, since it's more algebraic and categorical. But admittedly both definitions are abstract, and not readily computable.</p>
<p>A key role in our analysis is played by the action of $G$ on the simplicial curve complex $C:=C(S)$ and its reduced singular homology and chain groups ${\tilde{H}}_*(C, {\bf{Z}})$ considered as ${\bf{Z}}G$ modules.</p>
<h1 id="The-Simplicial-Curve-Complex-$C=C(S_g)$-of-a-Compact-Hyperbolic-Surface-$S_g$:"><em>The Simplicial Curve Complex</em> $C=C(S_g)$ <em>of a Compact Hyperbolic Surface</em> $S_g$:<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Simplicial-Curve-Complex-$C=C(S_g)$-of-a-Compact-Hyperbolic-Surface-$S_g$:"> </a></h1><p>Recall the curve complex $C=C(S)$ of the surface is the simplicial complex whose $0$-skeleton (vertices) $C^0$ consists of simple closed curves (modulo isotopy), and where a simplex exists between vertices $a,b,c,\ldots$ if the curves are simultaneously pairwise disjoint on $S$.</p>
<p>For example in genus $g=2$, the curve complex $C(S_2)$ is a two-dimensional infinite simplicial complex. Obviously $G$ acts simplicially on $C$ and the singular homology groups of $C$.</p>
<h1 id="Group-Cohomology-and-Bieri-Eckmann-Homological-Duality"><em>Group Cohomology and Bieri-Eckmann Homological Duality</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Group-Cohomology-and-Bieri-Eckmann-Homological-Duality"> </a></h1><p>The group-theoretic cohomology of $G$ is defined via the symmetries of proper discontinuous actions $X \times G \to X$ on $EG$ models $X$. The standard $EG$ model for the mapping class group is Teichmueller's $X=Teich(S_g)$, a topological $(6g-6)$-cell $\simeq {\bf{R}}^{6g-6}$.</p>
<p>We assume here the basic facts that $G$ acts proper discontinuously on $X$ with finite covolume. Oswald Teichmueller proved $X$ is a topological cell, and therefore homotopically trivial. However the $G$-equivariant topology of $X$ is highly nontrivial.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental observation of Harvey, Harer, Ivanov, that $G$ is a Bieri-Eckmann virtual duality group. This means $G$ admits finite index torsion free subgroups $G' &lt; G$ with $cd(G') &lt; +\infty$.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(Definition 1) A finitely generated group $G$ is a <strong><em>duality group of dimension</em></strong> $\nu \geq 0$ <strong><em>with respect to a</em></strong> ${\bf{Z}} G$-module $D$, if there exists an element $[B] \in H_\nu (G ; D)$ with the following property:</p>
<ul>
<li>for every ${\bf{Z}} G$-module $A$, the "cap-product with $[B]$" defines ${\bf{Z}} G$-module isomorphisms $H^d(G;A) \approx H_{\nu-d}(G; A \otimes_ G} D)$, $f\mapsto f\cap [B]$. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic properties of Bieri-Eckmann's homological duality are summarized in the following theorem from [Bieri-Eckmann].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(Theorem 1) Let $G$ be duality group of dimension $\nu$, with dualizing module $D$. Then</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(i) we have ${\bf{Z}} G$-isomorphism $D \approx H^\nu(G;\bf{Z} G) \neq 0$, so $D$ is a torsion-free additive abelian group;</p>
</li>
<li><p>(ii) the dualizing module $D$ is finitely-generated $\bf{Z}G$-module;</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iii) the homology group $H_\nu (G; D)$ is infinite cyclic generated by $[B]$ as additive abelian group;</p>
</li>
<li><p>(iv) the group $G$ has cohomological dimension $cd(G)$ equal to $\nu$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We omit the proofs, which are direct consequences of the definitions.</p>
<h1 id="Ivanov-Harer's-Wonderful-Theorem-that-$MCG(S)$-is-a-Virtual-Duality-Group"><em>Ivanov-Harer's Wonderful Theorem that $MCG(S)$ is a Virtual Duality Group</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#Ivanov-Harer's-Wonderful-Theorem-that-$MCG(S)$-is-a-Virtual-Duality-Group"> </a></h1><p>Most importantly for the mapping class group $G$, the dualizing module $D$ can be identified with the reduced homology of the simplicial curve complex. That is, we can identify $D$ up to $\bf{Z}G$-isomorphism as $D=\tilde{H}_*(C;\bf{Z})$, where the reduced homology group inherits the natural structure of $\bf{Z} G$-module from the action of $G$ on $C$. The curve complex has the homotopy-type of a countable bouquet of $(2g-2)$-dimensional spheres. Thus we deduce that $$vcd(G)=6g-6-(2g-2)+1=4g-5.$$</p>
<p>For example in genus $g=2$, this implies that $T_2=Teich(S_2)$ is a $6$-dimensional $EG$ model, and the quotient $G \backslash T_2$ has the topology of a $3$-dimensional complex. Thus arises the problem of constructing spines or souls for $G$ and we seek explicit constructions or realizations of this $3$-dimensional singular subvariety for genus $g=2$. Constructing such subvarieties is the purpose of our Closing Steinberg (CS) program  as we describe below.</p>
<p>Briefly the problem of (CS) is based on homological properties of $G$, and specifically a representation of Bieri-Eckmann's dualizing module $D$ with the reduced homology of an excision boundary $D\approx \tilde{H}_*(\partial X[t]; \bf{Z})$, where $X[t]$ is a $\Gamma$-rational excision of Teichmueller space $X$ for a sufficiently small parameter $t$. This terminology is non standard and will be developed in the following series.</p>
