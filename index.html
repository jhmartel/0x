</h3><p class="post-meta-description">[Under Construction] We discuss Faraday cages and the conspicuous absence of any proper mathematical derivation of their properties. This leads us to locate a source of confusion in the mathematical derivations of Faraday cage properties, and also leads us to review some erroneous alleged proofs. Ultimately we follow Assis and allege that the electric field inside regions bounded by conductors are not necessarily zero. In otherwords, there should be some motion in actress' tinsel inside the Faraday cage.</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 24, 2022</p>

    Weber Force Laws and Two-Body Problem. Again. [More Construction]
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description"> This post is under major construction. We continue to work on Weber two body problem with a view towards the more general N body problem. Again the challenge is that Weber's force law leads to second order linear differential equations which contain the acceleration terms implicitly. And this is obstruction to using the standard ODE solvers available to python. We have therefore been using a DAE (specifically GEKKO) to integrate the equations of state for the two body systems. However GEKKO does not offer as much visibility into the DAE solver as we would like. Therefore we have limited confidence in the accuracy of the solutions obtained.</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 22, 2022</p>

    Fermat Weber Points and L1 Problems with No Formulas.
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description">We record some very simple comments on the difficulties of computing Fermat Weber points of probability measures. These are points x which minimize the average euclidean distance from the points supporting a probability measure mu on Rn. The problem is that mathematicians need to stop asking for formulas for naive geometric questions. Besides formulas are not as useful as they might initially appear. Instead fast approximation and convergence are much more useful, although the resultant is not known a priori.</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 18, 2022</p>

    Weber-Kirchoff&#39;s Response to Veritasium&#39;s Huge Circuit Problem
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description"> In this post we present what we believe Weber and Kirchoff's solution to Veritasium's video on electricity. This video caused surprising uproar from physicists and engineers. The surprising degree of controversy is indicative a deep misunderstanding underlying electromagnetism, and this is where Weber-Kirchoff's original idea of surface charge distributions proportional to voltage being the cause of steady state currents in resistive wires. We recall that Weber and Kirchoff are the first scientists to derive the telegraphy equation, which predicts that electrical signals in conductive wires travel at the speed of light $c$. This is important work even prior to Maxwell's equations. </p><p class="post-meta">Oct 8, 2022</p>

    Deciding Injectivity and C.A.Feinstein&#39;s Proposed Negative Solution to P vs NP.
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description"> We continue to review and reflect on questions suggested by Craig Alan Feinstein's proposed negative solution to P versus NP. We are specifically reflecting on a signed subset sum problem, which is effectively a linearization of the unsigned subset sum. The question then reduces to deciding the injectivity of a map, namely from a large dimensional finite object to a much smaller dimensional but infinite object, namely integers. This raises the question of what is the computational complexity of deciding injectivity of maps? Is it really ever possible to deterministically decide the injectivity of a map without necessarily running through every evaluation? Along the way we discuss several aspects of CAF's work.</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 6, 2022</p>

    Computational Complexity of Fibonacci Sequences. Part 1.

</h3><p class="post-meta-description"> We revisit the well known subject of the computational complexity of Fibonacci's sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.. However we are looking at the question with Wolfram's idea of computational irreducibility. Yet Wolfram does not appear to define irreducibility, and this suggests the question of relating topological irreducibility to questions of computation, and this is somewhat speculative, as we are looking for strategies to prove that O(log(n)) is the minimal time complexity of computing fibonacci sequences. Can we formalize Wolfram's definition and obtain a strategy for proving the minimality of these running times? We're curious and this is exploration.</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 4, 2022</p>

    [Update] Weber Two Body Problem with Python and Gekko

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">In this post we present the basic python and gekko code for simulating two negatively charged electrons acting under Weber's force. The challenge is to obtain bounded orbits, i.e. to witness electrons passing the Weber critical radius and becoming attractive.

    [Under Construction] Weber Three Body Problem.
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description">Our goal in this post is to integrate the equations of motion for three charged bodies under Weber's force law. Why? Because we want to test the Sansbury proposal that the electron $e^{-}$ is structured, specifically as a 3-body system with net charge -1=-1-1+1. Yes, this is strange hypothesis and very important to investigate. But there is a challenge: the Newtonian equations of motion combined with Weber force are not the usual second order ODEs. This means we need to introduce a Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) solver named GEKKO, and this has delayed the publication of this post. With GEKKO we can solve ODEs of the form $F(x, x', x'')=0$. This post is theoretical. But we are working on the python notebooks for the actual code for Weber 3-body problem with net charge -1 = -1 -1 + 1. </p><p class="post-meta">Sep 11, 2022</p>

    [Under Construction] Weber Sansbury&#39;s Structured Planetary Model of the Atom

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">Bohr and quantum mechanics never explained the apparent nonradiation of the hydrogen atom. It was instead postulated, taken as given, and led to the quantum discontinuities, etc... But the great Wilhelm Weber (1804-1891) and the quiet softspoken Ralph Sansbury have a very interesting alternative, which answers everything that Bohr and Quantum could not, and succeeds where they surrendered, which is explaining the stability of atoms.</p><p class="post-meta">Sep 4, 2022</p>

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">E=mc^2 is the most famous formula in history, but what does it mean? Here we emphasize that Einstein derived the formula from mathematics in 1905, but Wilhelm Weber derived the formula from physics in 1860. With Einstein there is no meaning, no physics; but Weber has an immediate meaning in his particle electrodynamics, and E=mc^2 represents an incredible fact about Weber's critical radius and the possibility of 2=+1+1 as a stable electronic system!</p><p class="post-meta">Sep 3, 2022</p>
