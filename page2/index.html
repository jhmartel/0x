    Bohr versus Weber-Sansbury Planetary Model of Hydrogen
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description">[Chaos Post: Everything Under Construction] A simple question with non obvious answer. Which model is more probable, Bohr's or Sansbury's? It's a billion dollar question. This post has alot of words but not enough calculations. We need to figure out the correct KDK integration scheme for Weber's potential, and this is work in progress. Remember that nobody has seen the atom, and it is essentially unseeable since it does not radiate energy to the environment. But it's perhaps more structured than classical and quantum theories allow.</p><p class="post-meta">Jan 26, 2023</p>

</h3><p class="post-meta-description">What's the purpose of this website? To publish ideas, brief articles, and to collect and broadcast our work. All the posts reflect many years of work, although the physics posts are much more recent. We left academia, we failed to publish papers, and this is why we live in obscurity with nobody reading or mindful of our work. My hope is that this blog survives longer than I do, and at least the ideas are recorded here for posterity. This is our fault and we're fixing it.</p><p class="post-meta">Jan 17, 2023</p>

    Zero Subset Sums and Laurent Polynomials
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description">We have an idea about computing zero subset sums using Laurent polynomials and symbolic calculators. Essentially expanding powers of Laurent polynomials is computationally equivalent to sampling subsets of integers. It's trivial, but it's something useful that we've used with Mathematica and here with SymPy. There's an idea here which we probably learned from Dror Bar-Natan's Shameless Mathematica course and his categorical construction of Khovanov homology, Alexander polynomials, and Euler characteristics, etc..You can do alot with trivial observations!</p><p class="post-meta">Jan 15, 2023</p>

    Faraday Cages and Non Mathematics
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description">[Under Construction] We discuss Faraday cages and the strange absence of proper mathematical derivations of their properties. This leads us to locate a source of confusion in the mathematical derivations of Faraday cage properties, and also leads us to review some erroneous alleged proofs. Ultimately we follow Assis and Weber that the electric field inside regions bounded by conductors are not necessarily zero. In otherwords, there should be some motion in the actress' tinsel inside the Faraday cage. But why is none apparently observed?</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 24, 2022</p>

    Weber Force Laws and Two-Body Problem. Again. [More Construction]
    </a>
</h3><p class="post-meta-description"> This post is under major construction. We continue to work on Weber two body problem with a view towards the more general N body problem. Again the challenge is that Weber's force law leads to second order linear differential equations which contain the acceleration terms implicitly. And this is obstruction to using the standard ODE solvers available to python. We have therefore been using a DAE (specifically GEKKO) to integrate the equations of state for the two body systems. However GEKKO does not offer as much visibility into the DAE solver as we would like. Therefore we have limited confidence in the accuracy of the solutions obtained.</p><p class="post-meta">Oct 22, 2022</p>
